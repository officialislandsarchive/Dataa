----------------------------------------

Weapons are items that are used to attack and defeat mobs or other players if PVP is enabled. There are four different categories of weapons: Light Melee , Heavy Melee , Archery , and Magic . Defeating hostile mobs will award the player with Combat XP and XP for the combat skill of the weapon currently held. If no weapon is held, no weapon class XP will be awarded. The damage for each weapon increases for each level of the corresponding weapon skill that the players have.

When multiple players simultaneously attack a hostile mob, only the damage dealt by a randomly selected player will register.

Weapons [ ]

Melee weapons are weapons specialized for close-combat attacks. They have a chance to do critical hits which increases damage by 50% of the base damage.

Heavy Melee weapons [ ]

Heavy Melee weapons generally deal more damage than Light Melee weapons .

Light Melee weapons [ ]

Light Melee weapons generally deal less damage than Heavy Melee weapons. Most of these weapons have the same attack speed as Heavy Melee weapons, but the rageblade has the fastest attack speed.

Shields [ ]

Shields are weapons that can damage and reduce damage from mobs. They can also push mobs in a straight line.

Ranged weapons [ ]

Ranged weapons are not as effective in close combat, but more so at attacking mobs from a distance.

Archery [ ]

Bows deal different amounts of damage depending on the duration that the bow has been drawn and the player's Archery level. Full charges will deal full damage, while short charges deal less. Bows require arrows to fire, using 1 arrow per released charge.

Magic [ ]

Magic weapons do not need ammunition of any sort. Some magic weapons, such as the Slime Queen's scepter , may heal the player when an enemy is hit.

Critical hits [ ]

Melee weapons have a chance of dealing a critical hit (referred to as "star strikes" by Ivon ). Critical hits deal 1.5x of the weapon's base damage. All ranged weapons except for the lightning scepter do not possess the ability to land critical hits.

Since the January 22, 2021 update, critical hits from melee weapons will deal a fixed amount of damage instead of a ranged amount.

Event weapons [ ]

Event weapons are limited items that can no longer be obtained after their respective events have ended. They can still be obtained through trading with other players.
