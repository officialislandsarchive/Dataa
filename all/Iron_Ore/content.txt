Iron rocks naturally generate in the mining zone in the Hub , Emerald Mines ï¼Œ Slime Island , Buffalkor Island , and the Diamond Mines . Mining an iron rock yields 1 - 2 iron ore per stage, resulting in a total of 2 - 4 iron ore. There's also a 1.5% chance that the rock drops crystallized iron .

Totems [ ]

Iron totems can be purchased from Arius at the Hub for 4,000 coins after reaching level 18 in the Mining skill. An iron totem will spawn iron rocks around it when placed, or if placed next to a conveyor belt , the totem will drop iron ore directly onto the conveyor.

The test totem has the same function as an iron totem but has a different appearance and cannot be purchased from the Arius. The rocks spawned by the test totem used to have a higher chance to drop crystallized iron but was made equal to the regular iron totem around May 10, 2020 .
