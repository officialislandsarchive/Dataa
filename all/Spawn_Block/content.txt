Trivia [ ]

Without a Spawn Block, the default spawn point is the unbreakable Bedrock . NPCs and farm animals will spawn at the Spawn Block if respawned (by falling into the void). There is a bug that if the player breaks the spawn block, they will still respawn the same position the spawn block was. Players can place more than one Spawn Block on their island, but only one of them will be active.
