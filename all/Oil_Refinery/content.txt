Usage [ ]

Transforming [ ]

Oil refineries can be used to convert oil fuel into petroleum fuel . The oil refinery has one slot that can only hold up one oil fuel at a time, which must be inputted through the left input pipe at the front. The refinery, along with the petroleum petrifier , fuel barrel filler , and fuel barrel extractor , does not require fuel. As a result, the back conveyor belt currently serves no practical purpose. It takes 10 seconds to convert oil fuel into petroleum, which is then exported through the right pipe at the front.

Input Output 1 Oil Fuel âž¡ 1 Petroleum Fuel
