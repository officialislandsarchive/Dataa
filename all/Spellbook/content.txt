Trivia [ ]

The spellbook used to use the tidal spellbook's model from July 25, 2020 - October 1, 2022 before being changed to a new one on July 25, 2020 when the aforementioned weapon was released. The spellbook's animation used to be a "two hand shove" animation. However, it was changed to the melee swing animation after the March 19, 2021 update. Despite wizard lizards using spellbooks, they continue to use the two hand shove animation instead of the melee swing animation. Despite exploding upon disappearing, fireballs shot from spellbooks don't deal AOE damage. The spellbook's projectiles can collide with a wizard lizard's projectile, causing one or both projectiles to explode mid-path. The spellbook can fire through terrain and island parts, but cannot fire through game-generated structures or water. The angle the fireball launches is slightly delayed from the player's actual rotation, making shots inaccurate if the player is moving their camera very quickly. Spellbooks do not function correctly on private servers, as well as tidal spellbooks and ruby staffs . Spellbooks and Slime Queen's scepters are the only magic weapons that can be crafted without a Magic level requirement.
