Description [ ]

The Azarathian Serpent is a mini-boss found in Desert Island that has a 15% chance of spawning every minute after 10 minutes from its last defeat or despawn.

When it spawns, visibility everywhere on the desert map will be drastically decreased and a purple message appears in chat saying: "The winds in the Azarathian desert are picking up..."

When no player is near the serpent spawn location, the serpent is killed, or it has despawned, visibility returns to normal and a purple message appears in chat saying:

"The winds in the Azarathian desert have died down..."

Like other bosses, if no player attacks it for 5 or more minutes, or if the fight lasts more than 10 minutes, the Azarathian Serpent will despawn and the player will have to wait for another spawning to fight it again.

Trivia [ ]

The Azarathian Serpent is the first and only mini-boss in Islands that can be summoned by itself and cannot be summoned by players or tokens . It is the fourth boss in Islands that doesn't have its own token Upon defeat, it can drop other boss tokens, much like how the Slime King drops Slime Queen Tokens . When the Azaranthian Serpent burrows into the ground, its model is condensed into a ball and hidden until it unburrows and plays its pop-up animation. It is the only boss that can possibly spawn on another boss's arena
