Usage [ ]

Disabling totems [ ]

The totem disabler is a electrical component that, when powered, will stop all totems within a 10-block radius from functioning as long as the disabler is powered. The input and passthrough can be connected to other electrical components using a wire tool . It's useful for disabling auto-farms when the item limit is reached.

Range [ ]

The range of a totem disabler, if measured in full blocks, would have a radius of 9.5 and a diameter of 19. On the right is an image showing its range. The vertical range is 9 blocks. At that height, the horizontal range is 4 blocks. (The range is spherical; likewise, 9 horizontal blocks away, the range in the other horizontal direction is 4 blocks.)
