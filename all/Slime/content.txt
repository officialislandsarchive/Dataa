Trivia [ ]

Slimes used to have different damage and health values. Slimes used to be able to drop buffalkor island keys , but stopped after island keys were removed in the February 5, 2021 update. Slimes currently have the highest amount of variants, being 6. Slimes had a chance to drop a slime ornament during the Christmas 2021 event. The rarities of slimes from most common to rarest is the same as in Terraria (green being the most common and pink being the rarest in both games). The Slime King used be the only boss to have less health than a regular mob , having 200 less health than the ruby skorp before July 9, 2022 . At the release of the update, its health was buffed and is now higher than the ruby skorp's. The Slime Queen shares the same magical resistances and weaknesses as Fhanhorn . They are also the only bosses with the ability to heal themselves.
