Usage [ ]

Picking flowers [ ]

The industrial flower picker collects flowers within a 6 block radius from the center of the machine if powered with petroleum . It has 2 slots in its user interfaceâ€”one for the selected flower species and one for fuel. The player can select any color and species of flowers provided that they have at least one in their inventory . Once selected, the machine will begin to pick the selected color and species of flower - fertile or not.

The picked flowers will be outputted onto a conveyor belt on its side and powered with petroleum fuel through the pipe at the other end. The machine will not rewater the parent flowers for them to breed again.
