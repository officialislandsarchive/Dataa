This is the first block obtainable from a crop, the second being the watermelon . When the cauldron was first released, the un-grown pumpkin crop could be obtained instead of the harvested pumpkin. This was later patched and cauldrons give the normal harvested pumpkin instead. The glitched pumpkin's icon is the pumpkin seed when it is placed on the ground. It can be planted on any type of block to be grown into a pumpkin.
