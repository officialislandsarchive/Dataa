When a player summons Bhaa, a blue message appears in chat, reading:

"[SERVER] Bhaa summoning in 5 seconds!"

After 5 seconds, another blue message appears in chat, reading:

"[SERVER] Bhaa has summoned!"

If a player attempts to summon Bhaa while has less than 500 Bhaa tokens and on cooldown, the notification appears the screen, reading:

"Failed to Summon - You need 500x Bhaa Tokens to summon this boss!"

Like other bosses , if there are no players in the battle area, Bhaa will despawn and the player will have to wait another 120 minutes or use at least 500 Bhaa tokens before being able to summon him again.

Attacks [ ]

Staff Strike [ ]

Bhaa winds up for half a second before swiping at the player with his staff in front of him, dealing 45 (68 in Hardcore) damage and a large amount of a knockback.

Sandstone Hurl [ ]

Bhaa brings the staff over his head and waits 2 seconds before thrusting his staff onto the ground in front of him, causing the ground to hurl boulders at the player. If hit, the boulders deal 65 (98 in Hardcore) damage each and inflict the Stun effect, making the player slower and unable to sprint.

Skorp Summon [ ]

Bhaa will summon up to four skorps of any type in proportion to the number of players fighting him. These skorps do not despawn after Bhaa is defeated or has despawned.

Sandstone Spike [ ]

Bhaa will hit the ground with his staff, causing the ground to shake underneath the player's location during that time. A sandstone spike will shoot out shortly afterward and if it hits the player, it will deal 100 (150 in Hardcore) damage and inflict the Stun effect.

Effects [ ]

Stun [ ]

The player's movement speed is decreased by 50% and is unable to sprint.

Bugs and glitches [ ]

Sometimes when Bhaa is on extremely low health, he will stop attacking and stand still, allowing the player to easily kill him. If there are too many players fighting Bhaa, he may not have enough time to perform any attacks. Similar to the wizard lizard , he may occasionally do a T-pose when attacked too often. Bhaa may occasionally ragdoll and fling a skorp if standing on top of him. Bhaa may trip over, resulting in him flipping and being unable to get up.

Trivia [ ]

Although Bhaa holds a ruby staff , he is unable to heal himself or his skorps with it. Bhaa may be based on the Egyptian god Khnum . (Dubious) Bhaa is one of the two bosses to have his own soundtrack that plays during his battle, the other being the Infernal Dragon . Bhaa, Kor , and Fhanhorn are the only mobs that have a spawn animation. He was the second mob added in Islands that can spawn other mobs, the first being the Grand High Witch . There used to be a glitch where while in Bhaa's arena, the sun would start switching places frantically. Bhaa rewards the same amount of XP as the Wizard Boss , Infernal Dragon, Percival the Pumpkin King , and Fhanhorn. Bhaa and Kor are the only bosses that do not have any physical weaknesses. Sandstone spikes take no damage when underneath structures.
