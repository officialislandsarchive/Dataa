The Robux Shop is a UI element that can be opened by pressing its button on the left side of a player's screen. When opened, it plays a sound before displaying all the gamepasses and animal skins that are currently purchasable with robux â€” Roblox's official currency. They are separated into three tabs: Ranks, Unlocks, and Skins.
