Attacks [ ]

The Infernal Dragon has four different types of attacks that are executed in a specific order with a few random attacks executed sporadically. When summoned, it will start with a fire breath attack towards the nearest player, following up with a headbutt. Afterward, it will summon lava waves and end the cycle by summoning magma blobs before repeating from the beginning.

The dragon will fly into the air and go to a random edge of the summoning area whenever its lava wave or fire breath attacks are finished.

Lava Wave [ ]

The Infernal Dragon summons 6 waves of lava originating under its abdomen and sweeping outwards, spanning the entire arena lengthwise and dealing 75 HP of damage if hit. Each lava wave has gaps within them and a 10 - 20 stud gap between the following wave, allowing the player to safely pass through without taking damage. Once the attack has been finished, the dragon will fly to a random edge of the platform.

Fire Breath [ ]

The Infernal Dragon turns towards the targeted player and breathes a stream of fire for 10 seconds that deals 40 damage per second, dealing a maximum of 400 damage if the player does not move out of the way. The dragon will constantly reposition when executing this attack and will fly to a random edge of the platform after the attack has been finished.
