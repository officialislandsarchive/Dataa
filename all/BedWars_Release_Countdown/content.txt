BedWars Release Countdown Date May 21, 2021 - May 28, 2021 Description We've been secretly working on  a new game over the past two months. The game is powered by the same code behind Islands which means  we can work on both games at the same time! Players should expect no slowdown in the Islands update schedule either. We are committed  to regular, long term updates on any game we produce. The game will release on Friday (5/28) @ 11:00am PST. A countdown has appeared Islands hub to celebrate the release. The BedWars release countdown was a billboard that appeared in the Hub on May 21, 2021 , counting down the release of Easy.gg's second game, BedWars .

A billboard counting down until the release.

The billboard sinks into the ground and the BedWars portal comes up from the ground, replacing the billboard and adding a new button on the right.

Trivia [ ]

Fulco was moved closer to the fishing pond because of the portal size. The portal was removed on July 2, 2021 . BedWars became Easy.gg's most succesful game.
