Quests [ ]

Part 1 [ ]

Bailey greets the player and gives them a maple workbench and asks them to use it to produce 3 maple sap and bring them to her.

Guide: Place the workbench on your island. Use it to craft a tree tap for 35 iron ingots . Then, travel to the hub and buy a maple sapling from Cletus . Afterwards, go back to your island and plant the sapling. Wait for it to grow. When the tree is fully matured, place the tap on it.

After placing the tap you will immediately receive 1 maple sap. Through the course of a couple minutes, you will receive the rest of the tree sap you need, which you will then bring to Bailey.

Part 2 [ ]

Bailey teaches you how to make pancake dough and pancakes. She then requests you to bring her 5 cooked pancakes using your newfound cooking skill.

Guide: Craft a cooking table using a workbench tier 2 or anything higher. This will allow you to make pancake dough with 9 wheat each. Make 5 pancake dough, totalling 45 wheat. Then, put the pancakes in a campfire , small furnace , industrial oven , or desert furnace . Fuel your chosen smelter and wait for them to cook. When your pancakes are finished, bring them to Bailey.

Part 3 [ ]

Bailey is pleased. She then teaches you to make sweet pancakes with your trusty cooking table. She also gives you some extremely valuable machinery to refine the sap you extracted from that maple tree. She then asks for 20 sweet pancakes , promising a great reward if you complete her task.

Guide: First create 20 pancake dough, requiring 180 wheat total. After that, you must set to work using the machinery. It may be a bit confusing, but the machinery has wood tubes protruding from them, which act like pipes for sap and syrup. Connect the sap boiler to the tree tap you used for Part 1 of the questline. It will begin to boil the sap. Quickly connect the syrup bottler to it.

Note: make sure to read where the input and output tubes are on the machinery.

You can then wait for the syrup bottles to come out of the bottler. You can add industrial chest to the output conveyor belt of the syrup bottler to collect the syrup bottles so they dont fall on the floor. You will slowly but surely begin to gain maple syrup bottles. It will take approximately an hour to get 60 maple syrup bottles, the amount you need to make 20 sweet pancakes.

When you finally have 60 maple syrup, cook your 20 pancake dough, then craft the sweet pancakes and bring them to Bailey .

Alternative approach: Connect the sap boiler and the syrup bottler. Then, simply put the tap in.

Final Reward [ ]

Bailey will open the gate as she is sufficiently gratified. There is a whole new questline there with her cousin the berry farmer, Emma .
