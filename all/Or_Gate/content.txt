Usage [ ]

Players may connect an or gate to a power source from either input port to the succeeding electrical component from its passthrough (output) port using a wire tool .

If either of its two input ports receive power , it will passthrough the amount of power supplied. If both of its input ports receive power, it will passthrough the higher of the power supplied from each port. If neither of its input ports receive power, it will not passthrough any power. Or gates will still passthrough power with at least one powered wire connection (very similar to the combiner , but not the same (presumably).
