Patchnote #5 [ ]

More bug fixes are going live!

We've identified an issue where joining a server with a large island (40,000+ blocks) could crash the server if not enough memory is available. This results in the large island's data being corrupted (lots of missing blocks). As a temporary fix, we now deny large islands from joining a server if it will cause a crash. This means players with large islands may need to join several different servers until they are able to load-in.

We're working on ways we can avoid this type of restriction for large islands. For the time being, players with large islands are recommended to either join non-full servers or reserve a VIP server. We've also lowered the max player count to 22. We're hoping this lowered limit is only temporary.
