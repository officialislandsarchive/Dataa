----------------------------------------

Frog Jar Green Brown Yellow Frog jars are items obtained by catching frogs with a net on the player's island .

Obtaining [ ]

To obtain a frog jar, the player must catch a frog with a net. There are three variants of frog jars, matching with the three variants of frogs. From most to least common, the colors are green, brown, and yellow.

Players can release frogs from their jars like bees by using the item. Once released, the frogs will not despawn. However, since a maximum of 4 frogs can be on a player's island at a time, the player will be unable to release it if the limit has been reached.

Although frogs are able to respawn if it falls of the island, dropping a frog jar into the void will not return the jar or the frog.
