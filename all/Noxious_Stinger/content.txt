It is the first and only spear weapon in Islands . It is the third-strongest weapon in the game, with the second being the serpent's bane and the strongest being the reaper's scythe . When lagging, noxious stingers can make hostile mobs "fly". This is because the poison damage is being registered as having knockback. The Skorp Stinger from BedWars is based off this weapon.

This weapon is considered to be the best weapon by the community, due to it's high attack power and ranged ability.

It is the strongest Light Melee weapon.
