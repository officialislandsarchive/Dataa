Separating conveyors [ ]

The split conveyor functions as a normal conveyor unless it is powered. When powered, items on the conveyor will go off to the side instead of forward. The green arrow at the top indicates the direction of the output. The input conveyor belt cannot be switched to the side or right conveyor belt.
