Usage [ ]

The combiner is used for combining two electrical outputs into one, making a bigger power output. It only needs one input to be on to work. This is good if a big chain of electrical components is needed while having one line of wires.

It is sometimes confused with AND gate , which needs BOTH inputs to be on to work, and is the opposite of the splitter .
