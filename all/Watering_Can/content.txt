Trivia [ ]

This is the first item that speed up the growth time of crops , the second being basic fertilizer . Prior to November 1, 2020 update, the watering can could not be used on legacy flowers and had a limited amount of water. To show the amount of water left in the can, a blue bar would appear above the watering can. With every use, the blue bar would deplete and reveal a white color to show how much was emptied. If the watering can was full, it would have a maximum amount of 15 uses before needing to be refilled. Watering cans can still be filled with water, but this does not do anything other than deplete the amount of water in the water storage block. Unlike most tools , watering cans can be immediately dropped and does not require the player to hold down "Q."
