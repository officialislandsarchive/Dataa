Witches are now in the game. The Grand High Witch is also the first boss mob to be added in the game. When beaten, you earn a new trophy for decoration. This coincides with the sponsored event that started when this update was released. A new potion called Formula 86 is also brewable, which is needed to beat the boss. 4 new hostile mobs are also added. These mobs are the Skeleton , the Armored Skeleton , the Pump , and the Pump King . When slaying the Pump and Pump King mobs, pumpkin seeds can be obtained.
