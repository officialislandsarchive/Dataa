Attacking [ ]

At level 1 Light Melee , the Rageblade deals a base damage of 13 HP and can be swung every 0.5 seconds at default. It has the ability to damage multiple mobs in one swing and deals large knockback. There's also a small chance of landing a critical hit when using this weapon, meaning the attack will deal an extra 7 HP of damage. Its damage can be increased by leveling up the Light Melee skill and it is in the slashing class.

Like other melee weapon , only one player can hit damage in each hostile mob. Multiple players cannot hit damage together.

Rage effect [ ]

After 15 consecutive hits to a player, hostile mob , or passive mob , the rageblade will turn red and start to emit flame particles. The player can swing the rageblade from 2 swings per second to 4.5 swings per second in proportion to its redness.

Trivia [ ]

It is possible to "fly" on some mobs such as the buffalkor or skorps by jumping on one and continuously attacking it. This is due to the combination of the rageblade's knockback and fast attack speed and the mobs' large hitbox. The old model of the rageblade resembles a katana , a type of sword from ancient Japan . The in-game description for the rageblade is a quote by Mario Andretti , an Italian racer. Prior to November 11, 2022 , the rageblade was the second-fastest weapon , the fastest being the lightning scepter . This was the second weapon to have an ability, the first being the azarathian longbow . The rageblade model is equivalent to the Rageblade model in BedWars .
