Fishing [ ]

Fishing rods can be cast into bodies of water . After a short period of time, a fish shadow will approach the bobber and “bite” it. A UI will appear above the player's hotbar where they must keep a red block within a certain area until the yellow progress bar reaches the end. If the player fails to fill the bar within 25 seconds, the fish will disappear and the rod will reel itself in. The iron fishing rod can only be used if the player is level 20 Fishing .

History [ ]

Trivia [ ]

Before the iron fishing rod was added, the wooden fishing rod could catch any fish and treasure. Now, the wooden fishing rod can only catch lower tiers of fish.
