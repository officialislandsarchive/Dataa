Trivia [ ]

Crates are one of the two ways to sell seasonal crops off-season, the other way being using the industrial merchant teleseller . Every crate except for the crate of onions has a description that reads, "A crate of 100/250 [crop/fruit]". The crate of onions, however, reads "A crate of 100/250 onions... sure to make you cry." The large crate of plums is the highest-selling merchant offer in the game.
