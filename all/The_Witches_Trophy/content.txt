The Witches trophy is the first block to have “The” in its name. The statue depicts the Grand High Witch in its first/second phases. In the first few hours of the October 16, 2020 update, players could receive the trophy every single time they fought the Grand High Witch. This was fixed shortly after the event was released. The Witches trophy is the first trophy added into the game.
