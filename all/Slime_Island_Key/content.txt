Obtaining [ ]

Buying [ ]

The Slime Island Key could previously be bought from the Adventurer for 200 coins . It removed from the shop on July 11, 2020 , as players could, after that, come and go from slime island without the need of a key, but existing copies could still be traded with other players until February 5, 2021 , when the item was wiped from players inventories .

Usage [ ]

The Slime Island Key was a one time use item that was consumed from the player's inventory when going through the Slime Portal on the Hub .

Trivia [ ]

The Slime Portal Shard uses the same model and texture as the Slime Island Key, which is possibly the reason it was wiped. If a Slime Island Key was put into a Vending Machine prior to its removal, the amount would've displayed as 0.
