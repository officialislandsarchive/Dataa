Trivia [ ]

The desert island key was removed from the Wizard Lizardâ€™s drop table after the January 22, 2021 update as keys were replaced in favor of the newly-added Combat system. After the January 22, 2021 update, there was a bug where the wizard lizard cannot damage the player even though its attacking animation is played. This was patched 2 days later. The wizard lizard wields a spellbook that deals less damage than the spellbook players can craft. A picture of the wizard lizard can be seen in the explore menu . Unlike projectiles shot from players, projectiles shot from wizard lizards have a collision hitbox.
