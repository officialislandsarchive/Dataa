Usage [ ]

Transportation [ ]

Conveyor ramps can be used to transport items to and from industrial machines or automatable chests up or down a small incline. Conveyor ramps can also act as a merger , being able to combine the paths of two conveyor belts into one by dropping the items of one onto another.

Items without a flat surface such as iron ore and onions may occasionally have trouble going up. Players are able to be moved on conveyor ramps, but not when mounted on an animal .

The conveyor ramp tier 2 acts the same as a normal conveyor ramp but with double the speed.
