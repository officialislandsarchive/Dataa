Trivia [ ]

Before the May 26, 2020 update, buffalkors and slimes could get trapped in portals . Prior to the November 7, 2020 update, the buffalkor would show a third, usually invisible crystal on its back when hit. This has since been patched. Buffalkors used to have a high chance of falling through the ground prior to dying, depriving the player of any loot from it, although this bug was been fixed in the August 16, 2020 update. A buffalkor shows up in error messages. From June 18, 2022 - June 25, 2022 , buffalkors were able to drop Kor pet spawn eggs instead of baby buffalkor pet spawn eggs .
