Trivia [ ]

Skorps have received many changes since the release of Desert Island. The number of skorps that can spawn has changed throughout revamps, going from 3, then down to 2, and then up to 4. Skorps used to despawn after a period of time. Desert Island still receives the same amount of rain as all other islands . Desert Island was the first mob island that was not named after the mob that inhabits it. On April 24, 2021 , dead bushes stopped spawning, yet Azur's quest to break 15 of them was not removed, rendering the quest impossible to complete until the May 8, 2021 update when they were re-added. From August 13, 2022 to September 24, 2022 , void hounds used to spawn on Desert Island. These void hounds only dealt 8 HP damage to players and were smaller in size than those on Void Isles .
