Trivia [ ]

Pineapples are the highest selling crop , with the second being watermelons . Pineapples used to have models anchored in one spot, but this is no longer the case with Phase 1 and above. There used to be a bug where pineapple totems used to not be able to harvest pineapples. This was fixed shortly after it was found. Like starfruits , although the existence of oily pineapples in the game's code implies that it gets oily on conveyors , pineapples cannot get oily. Yielding an extra seed while harvesting pineapples are not impossible but has a near 0 percentage.
