----------------------------------------

The Chat is a feature that is built into every Roblox game unless the developer has disabled it, and is used to communicate with other players in-game. To open the chat, either hit the “/” key or press its button in the bottom left on PC or top left on mobile. Islands itself has some special chat tags and chat commands along with a few custom sounds that play when a player chats to another.

Note: You cannot use these features if you are on Xbox/Playstation or have your chat disabled via the Roblox settings.

Chat commands [ ]

Chat commands are commands that can be typed in the Roblox chat. They are usually prefixed with “/”.
