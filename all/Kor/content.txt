As of September 18, 2021 , the summon cooldown of Kor can be bypassed by using at least 500 Kor tokens .

When a player summons Kor, a blue message appears in chat, reading:

"[SERVER] Kor summoning in 5 seconds!"

After 5 seconds, another blue message appears in chat, reading:

"[SERVER] Kor has summoned!"

If a player attempts to summon Kor while has less than 500 Kor tokens and on cooldown, the notification appears the screen, reading:

"Failed to Summon - You need 500x Kor Tokens to summon this boss!"

Like other bosses , if the player is idle for 5 or more minutes or if the fight lasts more than 10 minutes, Kor will despawn and the player will have to wait another 60 minutes or spend at least 500 Kor tokens before being able to summon it again.

Trivia [ ]

There is currently a bug where multiple Kor can be summoned at once, whether a singular player summons Kor twice in quick succession (once with a Free Summon, again with Tokens right after) or two players summoning Kor at the same time. Kor is the second boss in Islands , the first being the Grand High Witch . It is the first mob unaffected by the knockback from melee weapons , although it can be knocked back slightly with any attack from ranged weapon except the lightning scepter . Kor's eyes glow and produce light. This also applies to its pet variant. Kor rewards the most XP out of any mob in the game -- 2500 XP, or 9999 XP with the 4x daily bonus. Kor, the Slime Queen , Fhanhorn , and Bhaa are the only mobs that have a death animation upon defeat. Kor, Bhaa, and Fhanhorn are the only mobs that have a spawn animation. Kor will not automatically despawn if it is flung into the void around its battle area, awarding no rewards and forcing the player to despawn Kor manually. Kor's health is 9,001, a reference to the "Over 9,000!" meme from the Dragon Ball franchise in which the character Vegeta says the phrase, "It's Over 9,000!" (source?) There used to be a glitch where the cooldown timer would reset after defeating the Slime King . Kor has the second longest cooldown timer, the first being Bhaa with a cooldown of 2 hours. The boss is featured in the luxury egg sculpture . Kor was (was? which boss is currently the slowest?) the slowest boss in Islands in terms of speed. Like Bhaa, Kor does not have any physical weaknesses. Prior to September 18, 2021 , the summon cooldown of Kor cannot be bypassed with tokens . Like Fhanhorn and the Slime Queen, a death sound is played upon Kor's defeat.
