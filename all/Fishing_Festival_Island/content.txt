Fishing Festival Island Jul 23, 2022 Original Villagers Thomas Oscar Taliyah Jed Ivon Cletus Fulco Mobs Fish

The Fishing Festival Island was an island used to host the Fishing Festival event.

Accessing [ ]

The island could be accessed in two ways, by going through the Fishing Festival portal in the Hub . Or by pressing the Fishing Festival icon to the right of the screen.

Event [ ]

The island was used to host a Fishing Contest for the Fishing Festival event. In the contest, players got 5 minutes to fish as much fish as possible. Players would receive different amounts of tickets depending on how much fish they caught, how many people were in the server and which place on the leaderboard they got.

Tickets were used to purchase various items from Oscar , the island exclusive villager .

Talking to Taliyah would give the player a free Shipwreck Podium .

Talking to Thomas would reward the player with 10 Sea tickets.

Villagers [ ]

The villagers on this island did not follow their usual behaviour. They all had new dialogue.

Only Taliyah , Oscar , and Thomas had an actual use.

Trivia [ ]

Exploiters could still access the island some time after the event ended due to the island still being in the game. This was later fixed by the developers by simply wiping all structures and villagers off the island, leaving only the terrain. There was an obby on the island, but had no use except for fun.
