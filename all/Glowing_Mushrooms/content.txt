----------------------------------------

Glowing Mushrooms are tradable event items obtained by catching snails and collecting the mushrooms in the Mushroom Obby . At the end of the obby, players will receive the mushrooms they collected. They used to be untradable but now are, and have no use other than decor. They can be watered, but don't produce more mushrooms.
