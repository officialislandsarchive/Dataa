----------------------------------------

An item is an object that exists only within the player's inventory and hotbar.

Behavior [ ]

When used, some items place a block version of themselves into the game. For example, water buckets turn into a fluid when placed, and seeds turn into a plant block when placed. When selected in the hotbar , items briefly display their names above the UI.

Some items can be displayed in the game environment by placing into a tool stand .

If an item is dropped, it will lay on the ground until a player picks it up, the island owner leaves the game, it is despawned due to the dropped item limit, it is picked up by an industrial chest or an industrial machine , or it is destroyed or disappeared in the void.
