Trivia [ ]

This skill was renamed from Animal Husbandry to Animal Care after February 5, 2021 . This skill has the highest level unlock out of all skills. Although the developers alluded to different advantages and special abilities for animal mounting in the February 19, 2021 update, riding animals serves no purpose as of right now, but only gives extra speed to the rider. Despite showing that the descriptions of roadmap "2 Large Animals" (Level 10 to 80) or "2 Small Animals" (Level 20 to 80), players could only spawn 3 to 7 large animals or 3 to 7 small animals. This is because the player's animal limit is actually increased by 1 (+1 with small animal) instead of 2 (+2 with small animal). Its limit was actually 7 (+7 with small animal) instead of 12 (+12 with small animal). There is a glitch that allows a player to gain Animal Care XP by repeatedly releasing a butterfly and capturing it again. When the player reached level 100 Animal Care , this skill doesn't have any unlock of roadmap.
