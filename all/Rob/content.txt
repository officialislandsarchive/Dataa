Players can store and withdraw coins to Rob anytime with no charge per transaction or interest. There is a coin capacity that can be increased by upgrading the bank's current tier for coins. It will display the player's current balance in their account and on hand as well.

Upgrading [ ]

The formula for the upgrade cost is

P ( n ) = { 0 n < 1 2 n − 1 × 100,000 1 ≤ n < 5 2 n − 1 × 1,000,000 n ≥ 5 {\displaystyle P(n) = \begin{cases}
0 & n<1\\
2^{n-1}\times100{,}000 & 1 \leq n < 5\\
2^{n-1}\times1{,}000{,}000 & n \geq 5\end{cases}
}

Where n {\displaystyle n} is the tier number.
