Trivia [ ]

The Void Serpent is the first and only boss whose summon message says which player spawned the boss. The Void Serpent may be inspired by Apophis/Apep, the Egyptian god of darkness. The Void Serpent's summon message is in the same format as Terraria's boss summon messages. This boss is most likely to be a reference to The Devourer of Gods from Calamity Mod, as both bosses are serpentine, can summon a mob to aid them in battle and have a head charge attack as their strongest attack. Many attacks seem to be based off of the Volcanic Sandworm boss from Soul Knight . The Void Serpent, Percival the Pumpkin King , the Infernal Dragon , the Slime Queen , and Draven are the only bosses that don't have a summon cooldown. They are also the only bosses that require tokens to be summoned. This boss has the most HP of any boss. This is one of the only bosses that drops its own token upon defeat, along with Zombie Cletus . Due to the constant spawns of void hounds , this boss is one of the hardest bosses added in Islands as the hounds do damage to players while the void serpent is vulnerable to attacks by players due to it being unbalanced. Like Zombie Cletus , the Void Serpent can be summoned over and over.
