----------------------------------------

??? Obtained when Unobtainable Description ??? The ??? Badge is a badge that was added in the August 16, 2020 update. The badge was used to hint the Roblox Battles Season 2 event. However, a new badge called the Islands RB Battles Championship Badge was used in place for the event instead of this one. The badge cannot be obtained and has since been removed from the game's page.
