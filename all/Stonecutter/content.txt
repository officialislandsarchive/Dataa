Usage [ ]

Transforming [ ]

Stonecutters can be used to cut certain blocks into their brick, tiled, or carved variant. It has three slots able to hold one item each in its user interface—two for unprocessed blocks and one for fuel. When powered with coal or petrified petroleum , the stonecutter will activate for approximately 50 seconds. During this time, it will begin cutting any uncut blocks inside, taking 16 seconds per block.

If a stonecutter is depleted of fuel while cutting, any unprocessed blocks remaining inside will keep their conversion progress. Progress is lost upon removing the incomplete material or if the owner of the island the stonecutter is located on leaves.
