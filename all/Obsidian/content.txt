Obsidian rocks naturally spawn on Pirate Island's Volcano and throughout the Underworld . Mining an obsidian rock grants the player 2 - 3 obsidian and 9 Mining XP (18 with the 4x daily bonus) per stage, resulting in a total of 4 - 6 obsidian and 39 Mining XP (78 with the 4x daily bonus) per full rock. The rock has a 4% chance to yield a crystallized obsidian when the rock gets fully broken.

Totems [ ]

An obsidian totem will spawn obsidian rocks in a 5 block radius. After the totem has spawned 6 obsidian rocks or has run out of space, the totem will begin to mine the rocks and hold rewards equivalent to a half of an ore rock, which can be collected by interacting with the totem.

An obsidian totem placed next to a conveyor belt will drop obsidian onto the conveyor belt.
