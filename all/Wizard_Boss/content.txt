Attacks [ ]

The Wizard Boss has 2 attacks. Similar to wizard lizards , it uses ranged attacks to fight and does move when attacking only very slowly.

Static Attack [ ]

The static attack is a long-ranged attack meant to attack players using a Magic weapon. It is similar to the legacy Lighting Scepter’s attack, a succession of lightning bolts are cast in a straight line at the player's current position. It deals 5 damage per hit. The direction in which the attack is cast does not change for the duration of the attack. It is an unusual attack, as it does small amounts of damage, but attacks multiple times rather swiftly.

Pulse Attack [ ]

The pulse attack is a long-ranged attack meant to attack players using a Magic weapon. It is similar to the current Lighting Scepter’s attack, a single lightning bolt is cast in a straight line at the player's current position. It deals 5 damage per hit. The direction in which the attack is cast does not change for the duration of the attack. It is an unusual attack, as it does small amounts of damage, but attacks multiple times rather swiftly.

Explosion Attack [ ]

The explosion attack is faster than any Magic weapon other than the static scepter. It has a similar projectile to the tidal spellbook and the same sound effect as the spellbook . This spell can be detonated prematurely by hitting the projectile with one cast by a spellbook, tidal spellbook, or spirit spellbook . The attack deals 40 HP.
