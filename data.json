Trivia [ ]  This skill was renamed from Animal Husbandry to Animal Care after February 5, 2021 . This skill has the highest level unlock out of all skills. Although the developers alluded to different advantages and special abilities for animal mounting in the February 19, 2021 update, riding animals serves no purpose as of right now, but only gives extra speed to the rider. Despite showing that the descriptions of roadmap \"2 Large Animals\" (Level 10 to 80) or \"2 Small Animals\" (Level 20 to 80), players could only spawn 3 to 7 large animals or 3 to 7 small animals. This is because the player's animal limit is actually increased by 1 (+1 with small animal) instead of 2 (+2 with small animal). Its limit was actually 7 (+7 with small animal) instead of 12 (+12 with small animal). There is a glitch that allows a player to gain Animal Care XP by repeatedly releasing a butterfly and capturing it again. When the player reached level 100 Animal Care , this skill doesn't have any unlock of roadmap."

    "content": "On April 5th, 2025, a serious Roblox platform exploit (not Islands) was discovered that allowed exploiters to steal items from any Islands player\u2019s inventory , without any kind of trade, interaction, or warning. This exploit was not caused by an issue in Islands itself, but by a vulnerability in Roblox\u2019s networking system. The exploit was quickly abused by exploiters, leading to widespread inventory wipes.  How it happened [ ]  Using third-party tools, exploiters were able to send spoofed network requests to Islands servers. These requests tricked the game into transferring items from other players directly into the exploiters' account without a trade, without consent, and without the victim knowing until it was already too late.  The exploit worked in any public place, including:  The main Hub Any published player island  Private servers were unaffected, but most players in public areas were vulnerable to random, invisible theft.  Impact [ ]  The consequences were devastating:  Full inventories were wiped from countless players, including rare items, blocks, and tools. Exploiters mass-stole items and redistributed or sold them, destroying the balance of the in-game economy. Players who had spent years collecting and building lost everything in seconds. With Islands having been officially cancelled in 2023 , the game was already running with minimal support, leaving players with little hope for recovery.  Easy.ggs Response [ ]  The only official response from Easy.gg was to work with Roblox engineers to patch the core exploit at the platform level. As of now:  No in-game fixes or rollbacks have been issued as of April 7th, 2025. Affected accounts have not been restored, and may never be. The chance of item recovery is considered extremely slim due to the game's discontinued status.  The player base responded quickly, with most of the reports and discussions happening in the Islands Discord server, where affected users flooded channels with evidence, clips, and warnings.  Players shared screen recordings of their inventories disappearing in real time. Many recommended others stay in private servers or stop playing altogether. The Discord moderators pinned safety notices and updates, but there was no public statement from the devs on future recovery efforts."

She has a small shop and a 3-part questline, the final reward being entrance to the area beyond the gate where the wild turkeys are.  Shop [ ]  Image Item Action Price Pancakes Sell 120 coins Sweet Pancakes Sell 220 coins Berry Pancakes Sell 750 coins Cornucopia Bed Buy 10,000 coins Turkey Couch Buy 1,000 coins Maple Couch Buy 5,000 coins Vanilla Turkey Bean Bag Buy 500 coins Maple Turkey Bean Bag Buy 50,000 coins Chocolate Turkey Bean Bag Buy 5,000,000 coins  Quests [ ]  Part 1 [ ]  Bailey greets the player and gives them a maple workbench and asks them to use it to produce 3 maple sap and bring them to her.  Guide: Place the workbench on your island. Use it to craft a tree tap for 35 iron ingots . Then, travel to the hub and buy a maple sapling from Cletus . Afterwards, go back to your island and plant the sapling. Wait for it to grow. When the tree is fully matured, place the tap on it.  After placing the tap you will immediately receive 1 maple sap. Through the course of a couple minutes, you will receive the rest of the tree sap you need, which you will then bring to Bailey.  Part 2 [ ]  Bailey teaches you how to make pancake dough and pancakes. She then requests you to bring her 5 cooked pancakes using your newfound cooking skill.  Guide: Craft a cooking table using a workbench tier 2 or anything higher. This will allow you to make pancake dough with 9 wheat each. Make 5 pancake dough, totalling 45 wheat. Then, put the pancakes in a campfire , small furnace , industrial oven , or desert furnace . Fuel your chosen smelter and wait for them to cook. When your pancakes are finished, bring them to Bailey.  Part 3 [ ]  Bailey is pleased. She then teaches you to make sweet pancakes with your trusty cooking table. She also gives you some extremely valuable machinery to refine the sap you extracted from that maple tree. She then asks for 20 sweet pancakes , promising a great reward if you complete her task.  Guide: First create 20 pancake dough, requiring 180 wheat total. After that, you must set to work using the machinery. It may be a bit confusing, but the machinery has wood tubes protruding from them, which act like pipes for sap and syrup. Connect the sap boiler to the tree tap you used for Part 1 of the questline. It will begin to boil the sap. Quickly connect the syrup bottler to it.  Note: make sure to read where the input and output tubes are on the machinery.  You can then wait for the syrup bottles to come out of the bottler. You can add industrial chest to the output conveyor belt of the syrup bottler to collect the syrup bottles so they dont fall on the floor. You will slowly but surely begin to gain maple syrup bottles. It will take approximately an hour to get 60 maple syrup bottles, the amount you need to make 20 sweet pancakes.  When you finally have 60 maple syrup, cook your 20 pancake dough, then craft the sweet pancakes and bring them to Bailey .  Alternative approach: Connect the sap boiler and the syrup bottler. Then, simply put the tap in.  Final Reward [ ]  Bailey will open the gate as she is sufficiently gratified. There is a whole new questline there with her cousin the berry farmer, Emma .  Dialogue [ ]  First interaction [ ]  \"Welcome the Maple Isles, user \" >Hi \"Do you know how to make maple syrup? My family has been making maple syrup for quite a long time! We loooove maple syrup!

During third quest [ ]  TBD  Completing third quest [ ]  \"These pancakes look amazing! Hey, I opened the gate at the end of the bridge for you. You should visit my cousin Emma !

Bees make honey during the day and go to sleep in a bee hive at night. A bee can be captured with a net to get a bee jar . The bee can be released from the jar by holding down left click for computer users, or for mobile users, hold tapping anywhere to release the bee.  Obtaining [ ]  Bees will appear on player islands with a large quantity of flowers . If the bees like the island enough, they'll create a bee hive on a tree . A maximum of 12 bees can be on a player island at once.  Behavior [ ]  Once bees belonging to the same hive have collected pollen 7 - 10 times, the player is able to harvest a honeycomb from their hive. Do note that bees can only collect pollen from flowers , meaning that they won't collect pollen from crocuses or regular daffodills . However, crocuses and daffodils are still able to attract bees to the player's island. Bees may multiply or continue to be attracted to the island if more flowers are planted.

Trivia [ ]  Since the XP update , there has been a limit to the amount of bees a player can have on their island , so if a bee jar were to be opened when the limit has been reached, the jar won't be opened. If a tree housing bees is chopped down, the bees will create a new hive on another tree to live in. If the current amount of bees on an island exceeds the maximum capacity of bee hives, bees will fly away from the island. Unlike real life bees, bees do not fertilize flowers in any way. However, bees will pollinate fertile flower types to create rare flower breeds. Bees are the first flying passive mob in Islands . Bees share the same flying animation as fireflies . Bees have the same wing model as fireflies. Bees are the first passive mobs that can be released from jars. Bees can go through The Hub portal unlike any other passive mobs.  Gallery [ ]"

He has 10,000 health and can be summoned on Desert Island . He has a summon cooldown at 120 minutes; 2 hours and can be summoned with at least level 36 Combat .  As of September 18, 2021 , his summon cooldown can be bypassed with at least 500 Bhaa tokens .  Description [ ]  Bhaa is a moderately-fast boss who specializes in ranged attacks. He has 10,000 health and can be summoned on an island across from the area where skorps spawn. He can be summoned once every 120 minutes; 2 hours with at least level 36 Combat .  As of September 18, 2021 , the summon cooldown of Bhaa can be bypassed by using at least 500 Bhaa tokens .  When a player summons Bhaa, a blue message appears in chat, reading:  \"[SERVER] Bhaa summoning in 5 seconds!\"  After 5 seconds, another blue message appears in chat, reading:  \"[SERVER] Bhaa has summoned!\"  If a player attempts to summon Bhaa while has less than 500 Bhaa tokens and on cooldown, the notification appears the screen, reading:  \"Failed to Summon - You need 500x Bhaa Tokens to summon this boss!\"  Like other bosses , if there are no players in the battle area, Bhaa will despawn and the player will have to wait another 120 minutes or use at least 500 Bhaa tokens before being able to summon him again.  Attacks [ ]  Staff Strike [ ]  Bhaa winds up for half a second before swiping at the player with his staff in front of him, dealing 45 (68 in Hardcore) damage and a large amount of a knockback.  Sandstone Hurl [ ]  Bhaa brings the staff over his head and waits 2 seconds before thrusting his staff onto the ground in front of him, causing the ground to hurl boulders at the player. If hit, the boulders deal 65 (98 in Hardcore) damage each and inflict the Stun effect, making the player slower and unable to sprint.  Skorp Summon [ ]  Bhaa will summon up to four skorps of any type in proportion to the number of players fighting him. These skorps do not despawn after Bhaa is defeated or has despawned.  Sandstone Spike [ ]  Bhaa will hit the ground with his staff, causing the ground to shake underneath the player's location during that time. A sandstone spike will shoot out shortly afterward and if it hits the player, it will deal 100 (150 in Hardcore) damage and inflict the Stun effect.  Effects [ ]  Stun [ ]  The player's movement speed is decreased by 50% and is unable to sprint.  Drops [ ]  Bhaa rewards 1,251 Combat XP (4,998 with the 4x daily bonus or 126 when maxed out) and 1,251 Light Melee , Heavy Melee , Magic , or Archery XP (4,998 with the 4x daily bonus or 126 when maxed out) depending on the weapon the player used to defeat him.  Prior to October 22, 2022 , only a certain number of players will receive drops if too many players are simultaneously fighting him. However, all players will still receive XP.

If there are too many players fighting Bhaa, he may not have enough time to perform any attacks. Similar to the wizard lizard , he may occasionally do a T-pose when attacked too often. Bhaa may occasionally ragdoll and fling a skorp if standing on top of him. Bhaa may trip over, resulting in him flipping and being unable to get up.  History [ ]  April 24, 2021 Added Bhaa.

September 17, 2022 Bhaa now has resistances and weaknesses. September 24, 2022 Removed Bhaa's physical weaknesses.  Trivia [ ]  Although Bhaa holds a ruby staff , he is unable to heal himself or his skorps with it. Bhaa may be based on the Egyptian god Khnum . (Dubious) Bhaa is one of the two bosses to have his own soundtrack that plays during his battle, the other being the Infernal Dragon . Bhaa, Kor , and Fhanhorn are the only mobs that have a spawn animation. He was the second mob added in Islands that can spawn other mobs, the first being the Grand High Witch . There used to be a glitch where while in Bhaa's arena, the sun would start switching places frantically. Bhaa rewards the same amount of XP as the Wizard Boss , Infernal Dragon, Percival the Pumpkin King , and Fhanhorn. Bhaa and Kor are the only bosses that do not have any physical weaknesses. Sandstone spikes take no damage when underneath structures."

Types of blueprints [ ]  Furniture blueprints [ ]  Furniture blueprints were used to unlock furniture items in the furniture workbench . Before the February 26, 2021 update, furniture blueprints were obtained by completing quests from certain villagers . Since the quest system used to obtain furniture blueprints has been removed, there is no way to obtain these blueprints without trading with other players. On May 27, 2022 , all furniture blocks were made accessible without the need of furniture blueprints.  Fish tank decoration blueprints [ ]  These blueprints were used to unlock crafting recipes for fish tank decorations in the furniture workbench. They were obtained by fishing or breaking coral . Since May 13, 2022 , fish tank decoration blueprints can no longer be obtained, being replaced by the Fishing skill instead.  Fish tank anchor Fish tank castle Fish tank shipwreck Fish tank treasure chest  Weapon blueprints [ ]  These blueprints were used to unlock the recipe for certain weapons, with rageblade blueprints being the only obtainable and useful blueprint. Skorps could also drop the blueprint for the vamp bow before the September 17, 2022 update.

When the May 31, 2020 update was first released, the item was accidentally left obtainable and had the chance of being awarded upon completing a quest, like any other blueprint. A few hours after the update was first released, it was made unobtainable by the developers. This blueprint was heavily duped afterwards. It currently has no use and clicking the screen while holding it will not consume it nor unlock anything.  Pancake blueprints [ ]  Pancake blueprints can be obtained from completing quests from the Maple Isles villagers , though they will not give a physical blueprint and instead immediately unlock the recipe. Bailey gives the player pancake dough and sweet pancakes recipes after completing her first and second quest. Emma gives the player berry pancakes recipe after completing her first quest. Don gives the player the Fhanhorn's pancakes recipe after completing her quest.

It can be spawned from chicken spawn eggs and can be mounted when fully grown.  It is the fourth animal passive mob in Islands .  Spawning [ ]  Chickens can be spawned through a chicken spawn egg, which can be bought from Taliyah for 4,500 coins once the player has reached level 12 in the Animal Care skill. Higher tier eggs can be obtained by breeding two chickens.  Behavior [ ]  Laying eggs [ ]  Chickens will lay infertile eggs shortly after being fed with their favorite foods or berries. If there is a nests or industrial nests nearby it might lay an egg in it, but it's not guaranteed.  Sleeping [ ]  When it becomes night (in-game) chickens will go to sleep. While they can sleep anywhere and sometimes will, they prefer to sleep on a nest.  Following [ ]  Chickens will follow players that are holding berries.  Dancing [ ]  Chickens within a 50 block radius of a playing jukebox will dance.  Interaction [ ]  Feeding [ ]  Chickens eat red berries , but will also each have its own favorite foods. The foods a chicken can have as its favorite food are pizza , baked potatoes , potato salad , roasted carrots , and roasted honey carrots . Feeding a chicken will give 3 Animal Care XP (12 XP with the 4x daily bonus). Chickens can also eat from troughs, but it will not give any XP when they eat.  Feeding a chicken will increase its food and friendliness level. The food level is necessary to keep above 20% or the chicken will start losing happiness.  Like other animals , if no troughs are in its vicinity, it will eat from a grass block , but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.  Petting [ ]  Occasionally, chickens can be petted, which increases the chicken's happiness and also gives the player 6 Animal Care XP (24 XP with the 4x daily bonus).  Selling [ ]  To sell a chicken the player must first inspect the chicken, after inspecting they must select the red \"Sell Animal\" button (located in the top right corner of the inspection menu). Then it will prompt the player asking whether or not they really want to sell the animal.  Notes: This will not erase its skin and the player must be the owner of the animal to sell it.  Mounting [ ]  Fully-grown chickens can be mounted by the player once they have reached Level 8 Animal Care through the inspection menu, located next to the \"Sell Animal\" button. Players can ride the chicken anywhere and the player can dismount by pressing the \"Dismount\" button on the right. Players can still use weapons and tools when mounted, and if the player and chicken fall into the void, they will respawn in the original spawn location. Mounting a chicken does not grant any speed boost or jump boost.  Breeding [ ]  To breed two chickens the player must feed both chickens a potion of fertility during the in-game day. Depending on those two chicken's traits will depend what tier spawn egg is produced.  Skins [ ]  The chickens skin can be changed to the tuxedo chicken once the player buys it  for 399 Robux .  History [ ]  February 26, 2021 Added chickens. Added the tuxedo chicken skin. Introduced where chickens are now able to eat grass blocks if no troughs are nearby.  Trivia [ ]  Chickens will dance when near a playing jukebox . This feature may be inspired by Minecraft's Parrots . It is a reference to the \"Party Parrot\" Internet meme. Chickens are the shortest animal in the game. Like all other animals, chickens may eat from a grass block instead of from troughs, but doing so will not replenish their hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP. This can be done if no troughs are nearby. The eating sound of chickens are reduced when eating grass blocks. Chickens share many things with other animals . Chickens have the same animations, amount of Animal Care XP, and favorite foods as ducks . Chickens have the same eye model as cows , sheep , pigs , frogs , and rabbits ."

Upon the release of the Godzilla vs. Kong event, players were able to cut down the palm trees on Skull Island , making it impossible to complete the first quest. It was fixed shortly after discovery, and the trees can no longer be chopped in the event area. At the same time, harvesting coconuts on player islands would not reward any XP. This was later found out and was quickly fixed by the developers. If a palm tree is chopped down while having coconuts on it, it will only drop the sapling and not any of the coconuts."

Killing mobs [ ]  Eating a roasted honey carrot will give a 50% chance of mobs dropping coins.  Spending coins [ ]  Players can spend their coins by purchasing items and blocks from a vending machine, buying items from villagers, or upgrading totems .  Losing coins ( Hardcore Mode only) [ ]  When a player dies in Hardcore Mode , they lose 5% - 8% of their maximum coins as penalty.  Coin Bags [ ]  Coin bags were items used for trading in the early days of Islands . They existed in 3 variations: 10 coins, 100 coins, and 1,000 coins. They were bought from and sold to the Banker . Coin bags were removed on January 22, 2021 along with the Banker due to them being an ineffective and unsecured way of trading, as many players used them to scam people and dupe coins."

Coin bags are physical items used for trading coins between players before the January 22, 2021 update. They have been removed and are only obtainable through trading.  Obtaining [ ]  Banker [ ]  Coin bags were purchasable from the Banker , for 10, 100, and 1000 coins .  Usage [ ]  Selling [ ]  Coin bags could be exchanged with the Banker for the same value as the coin bag; 10, 100, and 1000 coins.  Removal [ ]  Coin bags were removed along with the Banker on January 22, 2021 . Players that had coin bags before the update got 15% of the coins added directly to their balance.  They had become an insecure and ineffective way of trading coins and were mainly used by exploiters to duplicate coins. This obsoleteness was most likely the reasoning behind their removal from the game.  Despite their removal, some coin bags still exist in circulation but do not have a practical use as the original Banker who exchanged the coin bags does not exist anymore. The new banker ( Rob ) sells \"bank\" items, and is one way to access the player's bank account or shared bank account."

Certain crops dropped from crop totems will become oily when transported by conveyors.  Conveyor types [ ]  Tier 1 [ ]  These 4 conveyors are used to transport items forward, left, right, or up.  Tier 2 [ ]  These 4 conveyor types function like their tier 1 counterparts, but are twice as fast and have taller sides.

Randomizers are used to evenly distribute items/blocks from one conveyor line into two while mergers do the opposite. filter conveyors filter up to four different items from a conveyor belt. Split conveyors output items/blocks to the right when powered , and conveyor sensors create an electrical signal when an item passes through it.  Tomatoes , potatoes , carrots , and onions dropped onto a conveyor belt will become oily .  Totems [ ]  Placing a totem next to a straight, left, or right conveyor belt will make it drop its contents on that conveyor instead of storing them inside of itself or producing ore rocks .

When equipped with a mold, copper presses can convert a sum of copper ingots into the respective copper part. Once an ingot is inside the press, it cannot be removed and its only function is to be turned into a component.  If a player breaks the copper press with ingots still inside, the ingots will not be returned to the player. Ingots inside the press can however despawn given enough time or distance when not in use.

Bugs and glitches [ ]  Presses have a bug caused by switching press molds. For example, let's say you have a press with a plate factory mold attached and have it partially filled with 45 ingots. If you then take the plate factory mold out and put a bolt factory mold in, the counter will read 45/10. Once a press is in this state it cannot make parts or accept additional ingots. The only fix is to destroy and replace the press or to wait for the ingots to despawn or add another ingot inside the machine to receive the copper bolt (according to the example).  Trivia [ ]  This is one of the two machines that can use molds , the other being the steel press ."

    "content": "Cow Normal Lunar New Year Old Model Behavior Passive Location Player's Island  A cow is a large passive mob that was added in the October 3, 2020 update and a source of milk .  It is the first animal passive mob in Islands .  Spawning [ ]  The number of cows that can exist on the player's island varies depending on their level in Animal Care .  Player's island [ ]  A cow spawns on the player's island when it first generates.  Cow spawn egg [ ]  Cows can be spawned with cow spawn eggs . Cow spawn eggs are obtained by breeding cows or purchasing them from Taliyah .  Behavior [ ]  A cow can be lured with wheat and can sleep on hay beds . During the Christmas 2021 event, feeding, petting, or milking a cow had a 0.1% chance of rewarding a cow ornament .  Milking [ ]  A cow can be milked using a bucket , creating a milk bucket . Cows can be milked after fully feeding them.  Prior to January 22, 2021 , cows can produce milk buckets without being full even while asleep, due to them being unbalanced.  Breeding [ ]  After two cows have been given a potion of fertility each, they will breed, creating a cow spawn egg . The egg will be of a tier between 1 and 3.  Sleeping [ ]  When it becomes night in-game, cows will go to sleep. While they can sleep anywhere and sometimes will, they prefer to sleep on a hay bed.  Inspecting [ ]  Cows can be inspected to show a menu that allows the player to see information about the cow, listed below:  Mount Sell value Information Food level Favorite foods Happiness level Traits (fertility, productivity, and friendliness) Personality  Feeding [ ]  Cows can be fed approximately every 90 - 100 seconds. Cows eat wheat , but will also each have its own favorite foods. The foods a cow can have as its favorite food are berry pie , honey toast , bread , and tomato soup .  Feeding a cow will increase its food and friendliness level. The food level is necessary to keep above 20% or the cow will start losing happiness. The milking cooldown can also be skipped if a cow is fed.  A wooden trough , metal trough , or automated trough can be used to feed cows.  Like other animals , it will eat from a grass block if no troughs are nearby, but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.  Petting [ ]  A cow can be pet every 5 minutes which increases their happiness level. The action yields 6 Animal Care XP (24 XP with the 4x daily bonus).  Mounting [ ]  Cows can be mounted via the button in the inspect menu if the player is level 8 or higher in Animal Care . A mounted cow can be rode anywhere within the server. If the cow is dismounted outside the player's island, or falls into the void, the cow will respawn on the island spawn point. Mounting a cow does not grant any speed boost or jump boost.  Personality [ ]  Cows are assigned a personality upon spawning. All personalities have the same possibility, except for resourceful which is more uncommon.  Personality Description Effects Trivia Lazy \"Your cow is lazy. They sleep for a long time, but gain a bit of happiness while sleeping.\" Cow will sleep during the afternoon and evening, but will still gain happiness while sleeping. Before the January 22, 2021 update, all cows had the equivalent of this trait. Level-headed \"Your cow is level-headed. They will not gain or lose happiness quickly.\" Self-explanatory Loyal \"Your cow is loyal. They are extra happy around players and animals but can become very lonely when left alone.\" Cow will gain happiness faster if players and/or animals are within an unknown number blocks, but will lose happiness fast if they are further than that threshold. Friendly \"Your cow is friendly. They will bring you extra gifts.\" Cow will bring you extra gifts Resourceful \"Woah! Your cow is resourceful. They will produce items faster than other animals.\" Cow will make products (milk) faster than normal. This is the rarest personality.  Skins [ ]  The cow has one animal skin , Lunar New Year. The skin was purchasable for 499 Robux before going off-sale on February 19, 2021 .  Each copy of a skin can only be equipped to one cow.  History [ ]  October 3, 2020 Added cows. October 6, 2020 Players who don't have a cow will now receive one when they join. Cows will no longer try to eat from a wheat trough while asleep. January 16, 2021 Changed the cow's idle animation. The cow's tail now wags faster when idle. January 22, 2021 Updated the model and animations of cows. Cows can now be spawned with cow spawn eggs .

February 26, 2021 Changed the cow's favorite foods from carrots , potatoes , oranges , lemons , and apples to berry pie , honey toast , bread , and tomato soup . December 18, 2021 Feeding, petting, or milking a cow now has a 0.1% chance of rewarding a cow ornament . January 15, 2022 Feeding, petting, or milking a cow can no longer reward a cow ornament.  Trivia [ ]  Although cows can jump over 3 height blocks, cows cannot jump over blocks with around half-block height, such as slabs . When mounted by a player, the cow can jump higher while sprinting. Cows can escape a box that is supposed to be inescapable by walking through blocks while the player's island is loading. This also goes with most animals. Cows can sit on furniture blocks . Cows will be stuck once sitting on a furniture block. When the seat is broken by the player, the cow cannot move until the player reloads the game or mounts the cow. Cows are the first animal passive mob in Islands . Like all other animals, cows may eat from a grass block instead of from troughs, but doing so will not replenish their hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP. This ability was added in the January 22, 2021 update. Cows use the same eating animation as sheep , pigs , and yaks . This was likely can be done if no troughs are nearby. The eating sound of cows is reduced when eating grass blocks. Prior to January 22, 2021, cows had 1 hitbox and 3 hitboxes while asleep. Since then, cows can only come into contact with other cows. Cows are likely gender-neutral as they have features of both genders \u2014 they have horns of a bull but a large udder with of a cow. Prior to January 22, 2021, cows were 2 blocks tall but were changed to be 1.5 blocks tall later in that update. The old model of cows had a large udder with 6 teats, contrary to the 4 teats of real-life cows. However, the current model of cows have a small udder but doesn't have teats. Prior to January 22, 2021 , a cow stuck in the walking animation while idle, similar to lagging. Prior to January 22, 2021, cows could get stuck in the walking animation while idle or asleep. Cows are able to move with the sleeping animation, but this can be fixed by mounting and dismounting them. Prior to January 22, 2021, cows can produce milk without being full even while asleep, due to them being unbalanced. Prior to January 22, 2021, cows do not have a looking animation, similar to turkeys , horses , and vultures . The old model of cows is the second-tallest animal model in Islands , with the tallest being horses. Prior to January 22, 2021, a cow always opened its eyes, even while asleep. Cows share many things with other animals . Cows share the same eating sound as sheep, pigs, turkeys, yaks, and horses. Cows have the same eye model as sheep, pigs, chickens , frogs , and rabbits . The old model of cows had the same eye model as turkeys, ducks , yaks, and horses. Cows have the same animations as sheep, pigs, and yaks. Cows have the same horn model as yaks. Cows have the same favorite foods and award the same amount of XP as turkeys and yaks. The hitbox of players is slightly increased when mounting a cow. Prior to January 22, 2021, players could only have one cow on their island through normal gameplay. A cow mooing prior to January 22, 2021. Prior to January 22, 2021, cows had a mooing animation. Since the January 22, 2021 update, the mooing animation of cows was removed in Islands . Prior to January 22, 2021, cows had a different model, appearance, and animations. Cows, turkeys, and yaks have the same amount of Animal Care XP and number of favorite foods."

    "content": "Crops are plants grown from seeds or saplings that, when fully grown, can either be harvested or produce their respective fruit. There are five types of crops: Ground, Bush, Vine, Tree (Fruits), and Wetland. Each can be planted on grass , farmland , trellises , pond planters , or sand .  Most crops can be sold to Cletus for coins , sold in bulk to Dom , or crafted into other food items. Harvesting crops will give a varying number of Farming XP and a 0.02% chance of a Cletus ornament during the Christmas 2021 event.  Crop types [ ]  Bush crops [ ]  Bush crops can only be planted on grass and the bush itself is not collected upon harvesting. Harvesting a bush crop will drop some of its berries and, very rarely, a seed. The exact number of berries rewarded is scaled with the player's Farming level and is boosted for owners of the VIP gamepass .  The bushes can be watered but not fertilized, but watering one does not quicken its growth time. There are currently 4 bush crops, 2 of which are seasonal .  Ground crops [ ]  Ground crops are crops whose seed can either be planted on sand or farmland , but never grass . Harvesting a ground crop may reward the player 1 - 2 of the crop's seed along with the crop itself; the number of crops given is dependent on the crop type, the player's Farming level, and is boosted for owners of the VIP gamepass .  All ground crops have a respective crop totem except for cacti , chili peppers , spirit crops , and void parasites . Ground crops that can be planted on farmland can also be watered or fertilized to quicken their growth time. There are currently 15 ground crops, 14 that are planted on farmland, 4 of which are seasonal ; and 1 that is planted on sand.  Oily crops [ ]  When some ground crops are harvested by a totem and outputted onto a conveyor belt , they become oily. Oily crops can only be sold to the oily crops villager through the industrial merchant teleseller or washed in a washing station or industrial washing station to become their non-oily counterpart. There are currently 6 types of oily crops. (Oily Starfruit and Oily Pineapple are not obtained by having a totem output them onto a conveyor)  Vine crops [ ]  Vine crops can only be planted in trellises and cannot be fertilized. Harvesting a vine crop will reward the player the crop's seed along with the crop itself; the number of crops given is scaled to the player's Farming level and is boosted for owners of the VIP gamepass . There are currently 3 vine crops.  Wetland crops [ ]  Wetland crops can only be planted in pond planters . There are currently 2 wetland crops.  Tree crops [ ]  Tree crops, or fruits , are harvested from their respective fruit tree . All tree saplings can be planted on grass, but palm trees can also be planted on sand. Harvesting a fruit from its tree will always give one fruit and a 4% chance of dropping its respective sapling too. There are currently 7 types of tree crops.  Selling [ ]  Most harvested crops can be sold to Cletus , but the seasonal ones can only be sold to him on player islands during certain seasons . Crops can be packed into crates and large crates and sold to Dom for a higher value. Oily crops can only be sold to the oily crops villager through the industrial merchant teleseller . The sell prices of certain crops change for every update, but the sell prices will be reverted back to its original amount on the next update.

There is currently an unpatched bug in game where if a player leaves then rejoins on their island, all planted crops will be instantly grown. Chili peppers and seaweed are the only crops that cannot be sold. Pineapples are the highest-selling crop. Plums are the highest-selling non-seasonal crop. Before the January 15, 2022 , players were still able to obtain extra candy cane seeds when harvesting candy canes. Pumpkins , watermelons , radishes , blackberries , coconuts , kiwis and Plum are the only crops that cannot be used to craft other food items. Raspberries are the only crop that cannot be harvested by players. Turkeys cannot reward extra berry seeds when harvesting berry bushes . Prior to the June 3, 2022 update, Cletus could not buy crops from the player in the Hub ; instead, the shop belonged to Tom . During the Halloween 2022 event, Tom replaced Cletus due to Cletus being zombified."

Trivia [ ]  Crystallized gold used to have a drop rate of 2% \u2014 equivalent to the old drop rate of crystallized iron ; however, it had its drop rate buffed to 10% on October 3, 2020 in order to make it easier to obtain due to gold rocks being rarer. Crystallized gold has the same model as crystallized iron, crystallized aquamarine , crystallized obsidian , buffalkor crystals , and amethyst crystals , with the only difference among them being color and transparency. When the September 18, 2020 update was released, crystallized gold could no longer be used to craft the food processor and therefore had no use. This recipe of the food processor was later changed on October 3, 2020 and now requires 2 crystallized gold to craft instead of the initial 3."

On September 18, 2020 it was increased, likely due to the addition of drills , which required crystallized iron in its recipe. The limit for crystallized iron is 5,000. Joining a new server with an amount more than the limit in the inventory or hotbar will reset it back to 5,000. Utilizing chests or vending machines can allow one to bypass the limit."

Resources [ ]  Ores [ ]  The following ores spawn in the Diamond Mines can be broken by the player:  Iron Ore Gold Ore Copper Ore Diamond Enchanted Diamond  Four diamond rocks spawn after killing Kor , and there is a slight chance of an enchanted diamond rock spawning in place of a normal diamond rock.

Layout [ ]  The Diamond Mines entrance is located inside the Buffalkor Island cave, near the Wizard Island Portal .  Inside, the cave is full of gold , iron, copper , and rarely, diamond rocks . Different paths and tunnels with tall roofs twist around the island. The house of the Jed NPC can be found near the entrance to the mine. A greyish-blur fog covers the island.  An elevated tunnel in the right of the Jed's house leads the player to the platform above the void. Between the 2 ancient pillars, the player can hold F (keyboard), hold tap (mobile), or hold X (Xbox) to evoke Kor and start the boss fight.  Near the circular platform there is a pond. As of February 19, 2021 Update, there are no fish in it.  The Diamond Mines have one opening leading to daylight overhead, and it is possible to explore the surface of the island by finding a small rock tunnel leading to outdoors, entered via one of the underground caverns. However there are no items to be found there.  Trivia [ ]  The void under the Kor bossfight platform deals 1,001 damage if the player falls into it, instantly killing them. It is one of the two forms of environmental damage in Islands , the other being lava pools in the Underworld .

    "content": "Duck Behavior Passive Effect Speed (+25% when mounted) Location Player's Island A duck is a small passive mob added in the February 19, 2022 update. It can be spawned from a duck spawn egg and can be mounted for a 25% speed boost when fully grown.  It is the sixth animal passive mob in Islands .  Spawning [ ]  Ducks can be spawned through a duck spawn egg , which can be bought from Taliyah once the player has reached level 40 in the Animal Care skill. Higher-tier eggs can be obtained by breeding two ducks.  Behavior [ ]  Laying eggs [ ]  Ducks will lay infertile duck eggs shortly after being fed with their favorite foods or bread . If there is a nest or the industrial nest nearby it might lay an egg in it, but it's not guaranteed. Duck eggs laid in a nest or on a grass block will not despawn.  Sleeping [ ]  When it becomes night in-game, ducks will go to sleep. While they can sleep anywhere and sometimes will, they prefer to sleep on a nest.  Following [ ]  Ducks will follow players that are holding bread .  Breeding [ ]  After two ducks have been given a potion of fertility each, they will breed, creating a duck spawn egg . The egg will be of a tier between 1 and 3.  Inspecting [ ]  Ducks can be inspected to show a menu that allows the player to see information about the duck, listed below:  Mount Sell value Information Food level Favorite foods Happiness level Traits (fertility, productivity, and friendliness) Personality  Feeding [ ]  Ducks can be fed approximately every\u00a0?? -\u00a0?? seconds. Ducks eat bread , but will also each have their favorite foods . The foods a duck can have as its favorite food are pizza , baked potato , potato salad , roasted carrots , and roasted honey carrots .  Feeding a duck will increase its food and friendliness level. The food level is necessary to keep above 20% or the duck will start losing happiness.  A wooden trough , metal trough , or automated trough can be used to feed ducks.  Like other animals , if no troughs are in its vicinity, it will eat from a grass block , but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.  Petting [ ]  A duck can be pet every 5 minutes which increases its happiness level. The action yields 5 Animal Care XP (18 with the 4x daily bonus).  Mounting [ ]  Ducks can be mounted via the button in the inspect menu if the player is level 8 or higher in Animal Care. A mounted duck can be ridden anywhere within the server. If the duck is dismounted outside the player's island or falls into the void, the duck will respawn on the island spawn point. Mounting a duck will grant a 25% speed boost to the player, which can be stacked with chili peppers , potato and duck egg scrambles , the speed boost of horses , yaks or vultures and sweet rice desserts . When the player taking any damage while mounting a duck, it will no longer automatically be dismounted.  Personality [ ]  Ducks are assigned a personality upon spawning. All personalities have the same probability, except for resourceful which is more uncommon.  Personality Description Effects Trivia Lazy \"Your duck is lazy. They sleep for a long time, but gain a bit of happiness while sleeping.\" Duck will sleep during the afternoon and evening, but will still gain happiness while sleeping. Level-headed \"Your duck is level-headed. They will not gain or lose happiness quickly.\" Self-Explanatory Loyal \"Your duck is loyal. They are extra happy around players and animals but can become very lonely when left alone.\" Ducks will gain happiness faster if players and/ or animals are within an unknown number blocks, but will lose happiness fast if they are further than that threshold. Friendly \"Your duck is friendly. They will bring you extra gifts.\" Unknown Resourceful \"Woah! Your duck is resourceful. They will produce items faster than other animals.\" Ducks will make products faster than normal. This is the rarest personality.  History [ ]  February 19, 2022 Added ducks. Introduced where ducks are now able to eat grass blocks . April 9, 2022 Fixed a bug that prevented ducks from eating from wooden troughs , metal troughs , or automated troughs .  Trivia [ ]  Like yaks , ducks were unable to eat from a wooden trough , metal trough , or an automated trough . This was fixed in the April 9, 2022 update. Ducks are able to move with sleeping animation, but this can be fixed by mounting and dismounting. Like all other animals, ducks may eat from a grass blocks instead of from troughs, but doing so will not replenish their hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP. This can be done if no troughs are nearby. The eating sound of ducks is reduced when eating grass blocks.  Like yaks and horses , if a player mounts another animal while being mounted on a duck, they will be bugged and have the speed boost even when off the animal. This is due to the effect is removed only when dismounting a duck  Contrary to the duck spawn egg's description, ducks cannot be fed wheat . Ducks share many things with other animals . Ducks have the same eye model as turkeys , yaks, horses, and the old model of cows . Ducks have the same animations, amount of Animal Care XP, and favorite foods as chickens . Ducks were the first and only animal that has a processed food, bread , as their primary food; all other animals prefer raw crops . Like yaks and horses, there was a bug where the extra boosts granted when mounting a duck will wear off when joining other servers. This was fixed in the July 9, 2022 Update. Ducks were the first animal that granted a speed boost when mounted. Ducks were reported jittering when close to players, causing them to fling off the map or despawn, this was later fixed. Unlike chickens, ducks could collision with eggs or duck eggs into nests ."

Information [ ]  Duplication of items has been done since Islands' release. High-value items such as event-exclusive items , low-drop rate items, and hard-to-get items are usually the main targets of dupes. This usually causes the trading value of these items to significantly decrease.  On January 22, 2021 , an update introduced an economy wipe that removed coins and items that were above a certain limit. The update also introduced additional safeguards to slow down the distribution of duped items by limiting the use vending machines for players with a low Economy level. Despite the continued developments implemented to fix duplication bugs, dupes can still appear and should be reported in Islands' official Discord server here .  On December 29, 2021 , nearly all forms of trading were disabled due to a massive duplication exploit. The exploits have since been patched, but another economy wipe has not followed up.  Visual dupe [ ]  A visual dupe makes another hotbar slot appear to have a duplicate of the other. These items are often called \"ghost items\". The game will treat the items as if they exist, but they cannot be used for actions such as crafting or combat. The creation of ghost items is usually unintentional and has no penalty as it can be resolved by rejoining the game."

It is used to publish a player's island ( PROs only) and visit other player islands via join codes, invites, or online islands. Some features can only be used in public servers.  Features [ ]  Join Codes [ ]  Every player has a unique join code. They are shown on the UI. Below it is where one can enter other player's join codes. Upon entering one, the player will be teleported to that player's island if they are in-game.  Publish Island [ ]  This feature is currently in Pro Beta, meaning only players that own the Pro Gamepass can use it. This feature has two buttons: Edit and Publish. The Edit button allows one to change the display name of one's island. The Publish button moves one's island to a bigger 60-player server, and adds it to the Published Islands list. If this button is pressed without owning the Pro Gamepass, it will flash red and ask the player if they would like to purchase it. The description reads as shown below:  Local Invites (Private Servers Only) [ ]  Everybody in a Private Server is automatically invited to each other's islands ; their names pop up on a list next to a button that reads \"Visit.\"  Friends & Chat (Public Islands Only) [ ]  This shows all the players that are \"Nearby\", meaning they are in the player's chat group. If a player invites another player, the Visit button will appear, along with a red X button. The visit button will teleport the invited player to the player who sent the invite, and the X button will uninvite the invited player from the player who sent the invite's island. Next to all the names is an invite button; this allows the player another player invites to their island to visit their island without a join code.  Published Islands [ ]  This is a list of all the published islands that are currently online. It displays the following: the island name, the island owner's username, and the player count. Next to that information is a green Connect button; pressing it sends one to that island, as long as the server is not full. Above the list is a button that says \"Random.\" Pressing it will teleport one to a random published island.  Trivia [ ]  Published islands were originally called \"popular islands.\" Wizard Lizard appears above the \"My Join Code\" section. From December 29, 2021 to January 7, 2022 , published islands were disabled. Prior to November 11, 2022 , there was no option to hide the owner's join code."

    "content": "Firefly Behavior Passive Location Player's Island  Fireflies are flying passive mobs that spawn on the player's island during night time.  Spawning [ ]  Fireflies will naturally spawn from trees on the player's island during night time. There are 5 types of colors: yellow, green, red, blue and purple. Purple fireflies were an unobtainable item, until a player obtained some, and the developers were forced to add it into the game. Fireflies will only be able to spawn if there are trees on the player's island.  Icons Firefly Spawn Chance Yellow Firefly 90% Green Firefly 6% Red Firefly 2% Blue Firefly 0.9% Purple Firefly <0.1%  Rainbow Firefly Event [ ]  Every night, there's a 1.5% chance that the Rainbow Firefly Event will occur. During this event, every color of the firefly (except purple) will spawn on your island.  Usage [ ]  Catching [ ]  Fireflies can be caught with a net . When caught, the player will receive a firefly jar in their inventory. Firefly jars can be used to craft various items or be stored in a display case .  History [ ]  September 6, 2020 Added fireflies. May 21, 2021 Fixed bug that stopped colored fireflies from spawning. March 31, 2023 Fixed bug causing fireflies to stop moving when spawned.  Trivia [ ]  Despite the name, the Rainbow Firefly Event does not spawn any rainbow fireflies. There is a glitch that, if the player captures another player's firefly in a firefly jar, the firefly disappears. This also applies to dropped firefly jars. So the jar's description would be \"(color) firefly jar\" but there is no firefly in the jar. The purple firefly exists in-game and is the rarest and a legitimate item. Not much is known about the purple firefly and most information about it is purely speculation and theories. It was most likely a test firefly. There was a glitch where colored fireflies didn't show up during night time; this was fixed in the May 21, 2021 update. If the player clicks a firefly light with any firefly jar, the color of the firefly light will be the color firefly the player \"puts in\". For example, if the player clicks a firefly light while holding a green firefly jar, it would take away one green firefly jar from the player's inventory and make the color of the firefly light green. This works for every firefly color. Fireflies are the smallest passive mob in the game. Fireflies share the same flying animation with bees .  Gallery [ ]"

Accessing [ ]  The island could be accessed in two ways, by going through the Fishing Festival portal in the Hub . Or by pressing the Fishing Festival icon to the right of the screen.  Event [ ]  The island was used to host a Fishing Contest for the Fishing Festival event. In the contest, players got 5 minutes to fish as much fish as possible. Players would receive different amounts of tickets depending on how much fish they caught, how many people were in the server and which place on the leaderboard they got.  Tickets were used to purchase various items from Oscar , the island exclusive villager .  Talking to Taliyah would give the player a free Shipwreck Podium .  Talking to Thomas would reward the player with 10 Sea tickets.  Villagers [ ]  The villagers on this island did not follow their usual behaviour. They all had new dialogue.  Only Taliyah , Oscar , and Thomas had an actual use.

    "content": "A flower is a naturally generating plant that spawns in various forms and colors. Bees can collect pollen from a flower and transfer it to their bee hive to turn it into a collectible honeycomb .  Types of flowers [ ]  There are nine types of flowers that have their own unique color variations: lilies, daisies, hyacinths, daffodils, hibiscuses, roses, tulips, chrysanthemums, and lavenders. The color variations are the colors red, orange, yellow, dark green, light green, cyan, blue, purple, pink, white, mundane (gray), and black. Chrysanthemum and lavender flowers have a \"Chrome\" variant. Crocuses and the daffodils found on Wizard Island cannot be bred and can only be used for decoration purposes.  Color variations [ ]  Color Species Lily Daisy Hyacinth Hibiscus Daffodil Rose Tulip Chrysanthemum Lavender Mundane Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No Black Yes No No Yes No No No Yes Yes White No Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Pink No No No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Red Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Orange No No Yes Yes Yes No Yes No Yes Yellow Yes Yes Yes No Yes No Yes No Yes Dark Green Yes Yes No No Yes No Yes No Yes Light Green No Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes Cyan Yes Yes Yes No No No No Yes Yes Blue Yes No Yes Yes No Yes No Yes Yes Purple No No No Yes No Yes No Yes Yes Chrome No No No No No No No Yes Yes  (Note: Just because lavender doesn't possess the mundane variant, does not mean breeding combinations can't fail, the flower(s) will just not give an output)  Chrome variant [ ]  Chrome chrysanthemums and chrome lavenders are a special variant of chrysanthemum and lavender flowers. Their color changes in accordance to the day/night cycle; during the day, they have a purple color to them, and during the night, they have a navy blue color.  Daffodil [ ]  Aside from the colored variations of daffodils, a non-colored variation of daffodils spawn on Wizard Island .  Crocus [ ]  Crocuses can naturally spawn on Wizard Island. It can be used for bee pollination.  Legacy flower [ ]  Before the November 20, 2020 update, flowers didn't have a specific type and were simply named \"[Color] Flowers\" (referred to as a \"wild flower\" by Cletus ). They also were unable to be fertile or infertile and the only color variations at the time were red, yellow, and blue. They behaved similar to crops , meaning that the harvested flower could not be placed and could only be grown by planting a seed.  After the update, all placed flowers were turned into fertile lilies, and flowers in inventories or storage blocks were turned into regular, infertile lilies. Flower seeds were also completely removed from inventories and storage blocks in this update.  At some point, the red and yellow legacy flower models changed to the one daisies use. All three colors of the legacy flowers also received fertile variants.  Obtaining [ ]  Breaking [ ]  Flowers can be collected and harvested instantly by picking them up, but can also be broken using an axe or a pickaxe .  Flower Breaking Data Hardness 6 Best Tool None Max Hits Needed Material/Tool Axe Pickaxe Stone Shovel 9 Wooden 18 18 Stone 10 10 Iron 6 6 Gilded Steel 5 5 Diamond 3 3 Opal 3 3 Void Mattock 2  Natural generation [ ]  Some fertile flowers naturally spawn on the player's island , while daffodils and crocuses only naturally generate on Wizard Island .  The flowers that may naturally generate on the player's island are:  Fertile red, yellow, and blue lilies Fertile red and yellow daisies Fertile red, yellow, and blue hyacinths Fertile light green and blue hibiscuses Fertile red and yellow tulips Fertile black and red chrysanthemums Fertile purple and white lavenders  Excluding mundane flowers, non-fertile flowers of all species and their respective color variants were able to spawn on Butterfly Festival Island as foliage , including ones that can only be bought as a fertile flower and ones that normally spawn as a fertile flower.  Mob drop [ ]  Fertile red and yellow daisies both have a 1% chance of dropping when killing any type of slime .  Fulco [ ]  Fertile red and yellow daffodils and fertile red and black chrysanthemums can be bought from Fulco with flower tokens in the Hub .  In the summer , Fulco visits the player's island and has an equal chance of selling either fertile red or blue roses, but not both at once. The roses can be bought for 220 coins each at a limited stock of 2.  In the winter , there is a rare chance for Fulco to visit the player's island. If he does, Fulco sells fertile white roses for 450 coins each at a limited stock of 2.  Like with Cletus , other players can visit each other's island and buy roses from another player's Fulco.

Crafting recipes prioritize the kind of flower the player has the most. For example, if a player has 10 infertile white daisies and 1 fertile white daisy, the infertile version will be used first.  Bees [ ]  Bees engage in a pollinating behavior with flowers regardless of color or fertility, increasing the honey level in bee hives . Bees do not affect the fertility or breeding rates of a flower. They are, however, required in certain combinations of breeding, as well as increasing the chance of rare flowers in some instances.  Cross-breeding [ ]  The player can cross-breed two flowers of any color of the same species to create a new color variation , with a small chance for the flower to create a fertile flower. To cross-breed, simply place two fertile flowers or one fertile flower and one non-fertile flower next to each other and water the fertile one(s) with a watering can . Fertile flowers have colored particles and are marked as fertile in their icon name.  After around 10 minutes, a new flower will spawn adjacent to a watered flower. Watering flowers multiple times does not increase the yield or rarity of grown flowers, nor does it reset the growth duration.  Sometimes, after breeding flowers, the child (Offspring of the 2 flowers) will breed with a parent, for example, when breeding white and purple lavender, the purple lavender may produce a blue lavender, that may breed with the white lavender that hasn't produced an offspring yet, leading to a possibility of a yellow lavender. (Data that I found while breeding flowers, approx. 1/3 of lavender will show this interesting phenomenon)  Quests [ ]  Decoration [ ]  Flowers can be placed in flower pots (crafted in the pottery bench ) as decoration or it can be placed around the island.  Breeding combinations [ ]  This table shows outcome colors for breeding two flowers of the same species. With the exception of lavenders, any flower combination that is not on the chart has a 100% chance of producing a mundane flower.  Note that every breeding combination has exactly a 25.14% chance of producing a mundane flower instead of a colored flower. It is also possible for a fertile flower to breed with newly bred flowers produced by other flowers instead of the desired one and there is also a 6.45% chance for the bred flowers to have another fertile colored flower. Flowers of different species cannot cross-breed to produce a flower.  indicates that a bee must pollinate one or both fertile flowers at least once for the breeding to successfully produce a colored flower. Otherwise, a mundane flower will be produced.  Crafting ingredient [ ]  Any colored flower can be used to craft colored clay , glass , wool , neon , or solid blocks regardless of their flower type. Mundane flowers cannot be used to craft colored blocks.

Before breeding became possible, flowers could not be placed. If a player were to pick up a flower while it was breeding, it would become unwatered and not breed until watered again. Only infertile flowers used to be able to be used to craft dyed blocks . This was later changed to make it easier for players to complete Fulco 's quests and both fertile and regular flowers can be used to make dyed blocks now. The elephant banner and the lunar banner are the only items that can be crafted using mundane flowers. Although unobtainable, fertile mundane flowers show up in the crafting recipe for the two banners. Prior March 6, 2022 , tulips were composed of solid elements that could collide with players. Since the update, tulips became non-solid like the other species of flowers. Daffodils and tulips have the exact same color variations and all but one breeding combination, with the only difference being that red and light green tulips cannot be bred for yellow ones. Roses have the least number of variants. Lavenders have the most number of variants, having all colors but mundane. Tulips are the tallest flowers. Hibiscuses are the shortest flowers. Roses are the only species of flowers that do not require bees for any breeding combination. Other than mundane, the most common flower color is red. Chrome is the least common color. The fertile light green chrysanthemum is the second longest item name in Islands , the longest being the fish tank treasure chest blueprint . Walking with a chrome flower in the Void Isles will cause it to constantly change color from black to purple due to the island's lighting. As mundane lavenders cannot be bred from any breeding combination, it is the only flower type whose mundane variant is unobtainable. Daffodils used to have no mundane variant. The daffodil that spawns on Wizard Island may have been an early version of the daffodils that you buy from Fulco.  Gallery [ ]"

    "content": "Flower Seeds Red Yellow Blue There were 3 types of flower seeds : Red, Yellow, and Blue. There was a 25% chance to get a flower seed when harvesting flowers . Yellow flowers were the most common type of flower, red was uncommon, and blue was considered the rarest of all.  Usage [ ]  Flower seeds were planted on grass, and after a couple minutes, they would grow into the flower of their type; red flower seeds grew red flowers, yellow flower seeds grew yellow flowers, and blue flower seeds grew blue flowers. They could not be watered to increase growth speed. When the grown flower is harvested, you are not guaranteed to get a returned seed. If the grown flower was broken by a tool, then you would not be given a flower but only the seed.  History [ ]  April 10, 2020 Added red, yellow, and blue flower seeds. November 1, 2020 Removed flower seeds.  Trivia [ ]  Although flower seeds were removed, any flower seeds inside chests, and vending machines were still displayed, showing with \"0\". Any flower seeds in vending machines would display Buy/Sell flower seed but with no function when the button is pressed. However, this can be fixed by breaking the object."

However there are 5 ways around this:  Countermeasures [ ]  Players can only heal themselves by other means while afflicted with the effect.

Successfully attacking an enemy with an ethereal weapons , such as a Jolly Dagger 's healing , a Slime Queen's Scepter 's healing , or Cursed Hammer 's healing effect. The Chili Pepper is not affected by the food poison effect. Since the November 13, 2021 update, any foods are not affected by the food poison effect.

Formula 86 was a limited one-time polymorph effect item added in the October 16, 2020 update. It could have been obtained through crafting with items from the Halloween Event . It is a one time use item. It is no longer available to craft in the game as of the November 1, 2020 update.  Obtaining [ ]  Crafting [ ]  Name Recipe Crafting station Formula 86 3 Lollipop 3 Chocolate Bar 3 Orange Candy Workbench Tier 1 Workbench Tier 2 Workbench Tier 3 Brewing Stand  Usage [ ]  Formula 86 can be thrown at a certain spot the player clicks the cursor. Upon hit, it splashes and players in the splash radius receive the Polymorph effect, which temporarily transforms them into a mouse. Formula 86 is a required item to defeat the Grand High Witch . When the boss's health drops to zero, throwing the formula toward her will defeat her whilst morphing her into a mouse. Formula 86 can polymorph any player no matter who they are (excluding NPCs), but only for about 4-5 seconds.  Trivia [ ]  When the player successfully defeats the witch by throwing the formula onto her when her health is at zero, a banner will pop up with an advertisement saying to watch \"The Witches,\" when the movie comes out on HBOMax. (This event was sponsored by HBOMax) For mobile users, while the rat animation happens after getting hit by Formula 86 or consuming candy, the player can still move around. (though there is no indication of the avatar's location) After the animation, the player's avatar will be teleported to where it had moved to during the animation. This is the first and only potion in the game that does not need an Empty Potion Bottle . Formula 86 is a reference to the Formula 86 Delayed Action Mouse-Maker potion in Roald Dahl's The Witches . Formula 86 was used in candies as they worked via consumption. Hence, consuming candies causes the player to turn into a mouse. When hit by the Formula 86 and turned into a rat, you can still use a melee weapon and hit enemies. This has only been tested with desktop and may or may not work on mobile. This is the first throwable potion.  Gallery [ ]"

Once the limit is reached, the player cannot release any more frogs from jars nor will more naturally generate.  Behavior [ ]  Frogs can spawn during the rain. Rain does not guarantee that a frog will spawn, but it can spawn multiple frogs at once as well.  Like all other passive mobs, frogs are attracted to grass blocks and can also jump over 3 blocks at once. If the player drops a red berry near the frog, the frog will eat it using their tongue. Frogs can interact with some furniture items such as chairs, stools, and toilets. Once the frog sits, they will remain there. If the player destroys what the frog is sitting on, the frog will ragdoll. Like all other passive mobs, dropping a frog off of the island will make it respawn.

Updates add new features or change how the game functions, which can have unintended side-effects that affect other game mechanics. Developers for Islands constantly work on fixing these bugs while producing updates, as sometimes a glitch can make the game aggravating, or even unplayable.

Design [ ]  The color of grass varies depending on the current season . During spring , grass will become more vibrant, while during summer , grass will return to its original color. Grass will become more yellow-green during fall and during winter , grass will have snow on top of it.  Dried grass shares the same texture as the normal grass block but has a more yellow and saturated grass layer.  Obtaining [ ]  Natural generation [ ]  815 blocks of grass are naturally generated on the player's island when first joining the game. Additional grass can generate on resource islands .  Purchasing [ ]  Grass can be bought from John for 5 coins each.  Quests [ ]  Before the February 26, 2021 update, grass could have been obtainable through completing legacy quests . Since then, those quests have been removed, and grass can not be obtained this way.  Holes [ ]  After digging for truffles , pigs will leave a small hole that will grant 1 block of grass if removed.

If a block is placed on it, it will lose its top layer and become a dirt block. Tall grass , certain types of flowers , and wild rocks can spawn on grass.  Smelting [ ]  Smelting grass in a campfire , small furnace , or desert furnace will turn it into dried grass. Dried grass will turn back into grass when plowed or if a block is placed above it.  Input Output 1 Grass 1 Dried Grass  Farming [ ]  Saplings , berry bushes , flowers , and bamboo can be planted and grown on normal grass.  Using a plow on a grass block will create farmland. Wheat , tomatoes , potatoes , carrots , onions , starfruits , spinach , pumpkins , watermelon , radishes , spirit crops , chili peppers , pineapples , and void parasites can be planted and grown on this block. Plowing the farmland again or placing a block above it will turn it back into grass.  Farmland can be watered with a watering can or basic sprinkler or fertilized with basic fertilizer to turn it into watered/fertilized farmland respectively, allowing crops to grow 20% faster. Watering and fertilizing farmland will allow crops to grow 30% faster.

Trivia [ ]  When a block is placed on any kind of grass block, removing the placed block will always change the grass-variant block back to the original grass block. Grass is the cheapest block that can be bought from villagers , coming in at only 5 coins per block. Farmland is slightly shorter than the regular blocks. The thin colored grass layer makes grass slightly taller than regular blocks. A system grass block could be obtained via glitch. To this day, there are only a few users who have this item. Dirt, a grass block with any full block on top of it, is slightly harder to break than a regular grass block, in addition to farmland. Regardless of season, a grass block in the player's hand always displays the green spring color. Since the January 22, 2021 update, all animals , including cows and sheep may eat from a grass block instead of from troughs, but doing so will not replenish their hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.

In the event, players were able to complete a special event to obtain Tickets, which can later be traded for limited Halloween-themed furniture blocks and items. The Hub was revamped completely to be Halloween-themed. The Hub now has a greyish, gloomy effect. The music disappeared as well.  Locations [ ]  In the Hub, you find a new NPC called the Hooded Figure with the profession\u00a0???. Talk to him, and a screen with the shop appears. You will be able to get many various items, from Halloween themed furniture to a Cat Pet Spawn egg . You will be able to also interact with the event board, which will lead you into a queue to the Halloween Event - The Haunted Mansion. Once inside the mansion, you will be asked to talk with the hooded figure near the gate, which will give you a shovel, and require you to dig for the heirloom in the graveyard. In the graveyard, you will see black clumps that look like ores, click them with a shovel and you might get the heirloom. After collecting it, talk to the figure and go through the gate.  After going through the gate, you will be asked to find a entrance to the mansion. Find the F button on the screen and go in. Inside, you will find three things. After finding, you will put ingredients into the Cauldron. It is in the second level, beyond the wooden door. First light up all candles, then hold F to put the ingredients in. After that, defeat the Cursed Wraith in the first level. After defeating, you get 200 tokens, where you can buy stuff with from the new NPC.  Boss - The Cursed Wraith [ ]  The boss has two attacks. One, he uses his scythe to slash the nearest players. Second, he duplicates himself and shoots with projectiles. Attacking with Spirit Spellbook is recommended, for the boss uses close range attacks. Attacking from a further distance will allow you to take less damage and it will be easier for you to avoid the poisonous gas the boss produces in the process. The damage of each attack are unknown.  Rewards [ ]  Unlike previous events, The Haunted Mansion has players work together on the same team. Because the puzzle solving sections are collaborative, no points are awarded to anyone upon completing these sections.  The fight with The Cursed Wraith is the only chance for players to earn points - the more damage done, the more points the player receives.  The player receives 1 Cauldron from defeating The Cursed Wraith. Depending on how many points were earned during the fight, the player also receives anywhere from 20\u201350 tickets when the obby finishes.  Rank Prize 1st 50 tickets 2nd 40 tickets 3rd 30 tickets 4th 20 tickets"

    "content": "Horse Behavior Passive Effect Speed and Jump (Currently doesn't indicate when mounted) Location Player's Island A horse is a large passive mob that was added in the June 3, 2022 update. Players can ride it to receive a 100% speed boost and a 50% jump boost. Like vulture and unlike duck or yak , the status effect is not indicated when mounted due to its permanently boost.  It is the eighth animal passive mob in Islands .  Spawning [ ]  The number of horses that can exist on the player's island varies depending on their level in Animal Care .  Horse Spawn Egg [ ]  Horses can be spawned with horse spawn eggs . Horse spawn eggs can be obtained by breeding horses or purchasing them from Taliyah who is at the barn right of the center portal in the hub.  Behavior [ ]  A horse can be lured with carrots and can sleep on hay beds .  Breeding [ ]  After two horses have been given a potion of fertility each, they will breed, creating a horse spawn egg . The egg will be of a tier between 1 and 3.  Sleeping [ ]  When it becomes night in-game, horses will go to sleep. While they can sleep anywhere and sometimes will, they prefer to sleep on a hay bed.  Inspecting [ ]  Horses can be inspected to show a menu that allows the player to see information about the horse, listed below:  Mount Sell value Information Food level Favorite foods Happiness level Traits (fertility, productivity, and friendliness) Personality  Feeding [ ]  Horses can be fed approximately every 90 - 100 seconds. Horses eat carrots and roasted carrots , but will also each have its own favorite foods. The foods a horse can have as its favorite food are apples , baked potatoes , and bread .  Feeding a horse will increase its food and friendliness level. The food level is necessary to keep above 20% or the horse will lose happiness.  A wooden trough , metal trough , or automated trough can be used to feed horses.  Like other animals , if no troughs are in its vicinity, it will eat from a grass block , but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.  Petting [ ]  A horse can be pet every 5 minutes, which increases its happiness level. The action yields 5 Animal Care XP (18 XP with the 4x daily bonus).  Mounting [ ]  Horses can be mounted via the button in the inspect menu if the player is level 8 or higher in Animal Care. A mounted horse can be ridden anywhere within the server. If the horse is dismounted outside the player's island or falls into the void, the horse will respawn on the island spawn point. Mounting a horse will grant a 100% or 2x speed boost and a 50% or 1.5x jump boost that stacks with other items that grant bonus movement speed and jump power. When the player taking any damage while mounting a horse, it will no longer automatically be dismounted. Contrary to its info, breeding higher tier of horse will doesn't raise its permanently boost either the speed or jump boost.  Like mounting a vulture and unlike mounting a duck or yak , the status effect icon of horse is doesn't indicate when mounted due to its permanently boost.  Personality [ ]  Horses are assigned a personality upon spawning. All personalities have the same possibility, except for resourceful which is more uncommon.  Personality Description Effects Trivia Lazy \"Your horse is lazy. They sleep for a long time, but gain a bit of happiness while sleeping.\" Horse will sleep during the afternoon and evening, but will still gain happiness while sleeping. Level-headed \"Your horse is level-headed. They will not gain or lose happiness quickly.\" Self-explanatory. Loyal \"Your horse is loyal. They are extra happy around players and animals but can become very lonely when left alone.\" Horse will gain happiness faster if players and/or animals are within an unknown number of blocks, but will lose happiness fast if they are further than that threshold. Friendly \"Your horse is friendly. They will bring you extra gifts.\" Unknown. Resourceful \"Woah! Your horse is resourceful. They will produce items faster than other animals.\" Horse will make products faster than normal. This is the rarest personality.  History [ ]  June 3, 2022 Added horses. Introduced where horses are now able to eat grass blocks if no troughs are nearby. Introduced where the status effect icon doesn't indicate when mounting a horse. June 10, 2022 Horses can now be fed spinach . Baked potatoes and bread may now be a horse's favorite food.  Trivia [ ]  Like all other animals, horses may eat from a grass block instead of from troughs, but doing so will not replenish their hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP. This was likely can be done if no troughs are nearby. The eating sound of horses is reduced when eating grass blocks. Unlike most animals, horses doesn't have an eating animation when eating grass blocks. Horses are the tallest animal model in Islands , with the second-tallest being the old model of cows .

It is accessed through the portal on the player's island . Most villagers are located in the Hub.  Resources [ ]  Villagers [ ]  Portals [ ]  There are currently three portals in the Hub - one large one near the central area leading back to the player's island , one next to Ivon leading to Slime Island and one at the end of the path near Melody and Fulco that leads to Maple Isles . During the PvP Alpha , PvP Beta , Fishing Festival , Godzilla vs. Kong , and Farming Festival events, portal(s) to their respective event island(s) opened in the central area.

There was a very long tunnel near where snow and ice used to spawn in the hub, but it just leaded to another side of the hub. By the river, behind the arch, there was a hidden cave that lead to a rock with a glowing white stone sword stuck inside. This sword hinted the Mercenary . Near the icy mountain behind the castle, behind the mountain, a hidden tunnel could be found that leads to a glowing ice crystal. There was a helmet under a pine tree ; it was located behind Ivon . On the house next to Ivon, there was a small character in the roof titled \"baby\". On the blue house with the windmill, there was a small character in the roof with no title. During Christmas 2020 event, there was a trap door which led to a cave where players would find a larger version of a snow globe , some presents , and a snowman carrying its head. Before the Godzilla vs. Kong event, glowing red rocks that looked like meteorites spawned on the mountains. The purpose is unknown. In the left side of the castle, there was a cave with a shaking wagon in it.  Trivia [ ]  There was a countdown located on the statue in the main area of the Hub which counted down to August 13, 2022. This is one of the two oldest locations in the game, the other being the player's island . The Hub and Player's Island shared the same server until the November 1, 2020 update separated the two islands, making it so if the player is on a private server, the Hub will still be on the same server. It was changed on November 7, 2020 . The Hub has went through various versions, the original, the Halloween 2020 event, the second version , the Christmas 2020 event, the Godzilla vs. Kong event, the Patrick Star Event , the modified second one , the Halloween 2021 event, and the current. Taliyah's barn was first added as a construction zone before the building was actually revealed, and was remodeled three times afterwards, on November 1, 2020 , February 26, 2021 , and October 18, 2021 . Electrite rocks used to be able to spawn on the Hub Mountain, but was changed for them to only spawn on Buffalkor Island on January 4, 2021 . In the July 17, 2021 update, the hub got a small expansion with Hannah and her pirate ship which leads to Pirate Island . They are located at the docks past Dom and Thomas . In private servers, the Hub will occasionally glitch and not load in properly when the player first spawns there, resulting in players falling through the Hub and into the void before respawning back at their island. A skeleton near the portal during the Halloween 2022 event was not anchored and therefore scatter into movable pieces when the player spawns in. This was fixed in the October 22, 2022 update.

Trivia [ ]  The conveyor attachment's arrows will always point inwards even if the mode is set to \"out\". Despite being crafted with a medium chest which can hold 60 items per slot, this chest can only hold 5 items per slot. This is currently the only way to get rid of wooden tools, since they cannot be dropped. There is a bug that makes ingots fall to the bottom of the chest if the chest is full, even when it is empty. Due to a bug, scroll-clicking on an industrial chest adds the Small Chest to the hotbar, instead of the industrial chest."

It has 13,000 health and can be summoned in the Underworld for at least 750 Underworld Tokens . It has no summon cooldown.  Description [ ]  The Infernal Dragon can be summoned at the bottom of the stairway to its arena in the Underworld for at least 750 Underworld tokens .  Like other bosses , if there are no players in the arena, if the player is idle for too long, or if the battle takes more than 10 minutes, the Infernal Dragon will despawn and the player will have to respawn it with at least 750 more Underworld tokens.  Attacks [ ]  The Infernal Dragon has four different types of attacks that are executed in a specific order with a few random attacks executed sporadically. When summoned, it will start with a fire breath attack towards the nearest player, following up with a headbutt. Afterward, it will summon lava waves and end the cycle by summoning magma blobs before repeating from the beginning.  The dragon will fly into the air and go to a random edge of the summoning area whenever its lava wave or fire breath attacks are finished.  Lava Wave [ ]  The Infernal Dragon summons 6 waves of lava originating under its abdomen and sweeping outwards, spanning the entire arena lengthwise and dealing 75 HP of damage if hit. Each lava wave has gaps within them and a 10 - 20 stud gap between the following wave, allowing the player to safely pass through without taking damage. Once the attack has been finished, the dragon will fly to a random edge of the platform.  Fire Breath [ ]  The Infernal Dragon turns towards the targeted player and breathes a stream of fire for 10 seconds that deals 40 damage per second, dealing a maximum of 400 damage if the player does not move out of the way. The dragon will constantly reposition when executing this attack and will fly to a random edge of the platform after the attack has been finished.  Headbutt [ ]  The Infernal Dragon targets a random player and moves forward to hit them with its head, knocking them back and dealing between 25 and 50 damage if hit. The headbutt can pierce, which damages multiple players at a time.  Summon [ ]  The Infernal Dragon summons between 1 and 7 magma blobs ; the number summoned varies in proportion to the number of players currently fighting the dragon.

Some items can be displayed in the game environment by placing into a tool stand .  If an item is dropped, it will lay on the ground until a player picks it up, the island owner leaves the game, it is despawned due to the dropped item limit, it is picked up by an industrial chest or an industrial machine , or it is destroyed or disappeared in the void.  List of items [ ]  Items that create blocks, fluids or entities [ ]  Items with use in the game [ ]  These items, when highlighted in a player's hotbar (a.k.a \"held\"), can be used by either attack or use, or can serve a specific purpose (for example, offer the player an advantage or disadvantage). Some can be used at any time, while others only when aiming at specific blocks or mobs .  Items with indirect use in the game [ ]  The player cannot interact with or directly use these items; however, some can be sold or used in crafting recipes for other items that do have direct uses.  Removed items [ ]  These items have at one point in time been obtainable, but has since been removed from players' inventories, vending machines, and chests. Despite this, they may still exist in some players' inventories.  Unimplemented items [ ]  These items exist in the game's files but have been left unused or unimplemented due to various reasons."

Attacking [ ]  At level 1 Light Melee , the jolly dagger deals a base damage of 52 HP and can be swung every 0.5 seconds. There is a small chance this weapon does a critical hit, meaning the attack will do an extra 26 HP of damage. The weapon also heals the player 5% HP when attacking a mob. Its damage can be increased by leveling up the Light Melee skill and it is in the slashing and ethereal classes.  Like other melee weapon , only one player can hit damage in each hostile mob. Multiple players cannot hit damage together.  History [ ]  December 23, 2022 Added jolly daggers. January 6, 2023 Jolly daggers can now be dropped, traded , and put in vending machines and chests .  Trivia [ ]  More than one Jolly Dagger can be obtained per account as the quest is repeatable. The jolly dagger is one of the only melee weapons with a magical classification, with the others being the frost hammer , the frost sword , the infernal hammer , the trout's fury , the serpent's hook , and the reaper's scythe . If the mob has a weakness or resistance to both of its classification, then the damage multiplier will be either higher or lower than normal. While if the mob has a weakness and resistance to each of its classification, then neutral damage will apply."

When a player summons Kor, a blue message appears in chat, reading:  \"[SERVER] Kor summoning in 5 seconds!\"  After 5 seconds, another blue message appears in chat, reading:  \"[SERVER] Kor has summoned!\"  If a player attempts to summon Kor while has less than 500 Kor tokens and on cooldown, the notification appears the screen, reading:  \"Failed to Summon - You need 500x Kor Tokens to summon this boss!\"  Like other bosses , if the player is idle for 5 or more minutes or if the fight lasts more than 10 minutes, Kor will despawn and the player will have to wait another 60 minutes or spend at least 500 Kor tokens before being able to summon it again.  Attacks [ ]  Punch Attack [ ]  Kor will reel back one of its arms before swinging at the player in front of it, dealing 40 damage and significant knockback to the player.  Stomp Attack [ ]  Kor will lift up its foot and stomp on the ground, creating a wave of rocks in the form of a circle around it. If hit, the rocks deal 35 damage and inflict the Stun effects.  Smash Attack [ ]  Kor will reel back both of its arms before smashing them at the player in front of it, dealing 111 damage. This attack will always be used if its stomp attack hits a player.  Effects [ ]  Stun [ ]  The player's movement speed is decreased by 50% or unable to sprint.  Drops [ ]  Kor rewards 2,500 (9,999 with the 4x daily bonus or 249 when maxed out) Combat XP and 2,500 (9,999 with the 4x daily bonus or 249 when maxed out) Light Melee , Heavy Melee , Magic , or Archery XP depending on the weapon the player used to defeat it. In addition to the following drops, four diamond rocks will spawn in the battle area. There is also a small chance for an enchanted diamond rock to spawn in place of a normal diamond rock.

Each Kor kill yields four diamond rocks that yield the same amount of diamonds per stage no matter the player count.  Damage reduction [ ]  Kor reduces the amount of damage dealt to it by 10% to 55% depending on the number of players (compounds) in the arena.

September 5, 2021 Kor is now able to drop mysterious fragment #2s with a 3.33% chance. September 11, 2021 Changed the drop chance of mysterious fragment #2's to 5%. September 18, 2021 The cooldown of Kor can now be bypassed with Kor tokens . Kor is now able to drop Kor pet spawn eggs . April 16, 2022 Fixed Kor's stomp attack. August 15, 2022 Fixed a bug that allowed Kor to spawn multiple diamond rocks . August 20, 2022 Correctly fixed the bug that allowed Kor to spawn multiple diamond rocks .  Trivia [ ]  There is currently a bug where multiple Kor can be summoned at once, whether a singular player summons Kor twice in quick succession (once with a Free Summon, again with Tokens right after) or two players summoning Kor at the same time. Kor is the second boss in Islands , the first being the Grand High Witch . It is the first mob unaffected by the knockback from melee weapons , although it can be knocked back slightly with any attack from ranged weapon except the lightning scepter . Kor's eyes glow and produce light. This also applies to its pet variant. Kor rewards the most XP out of any mob in the game -- 2500 XP, or 9999 XP with the 4x daily bonus. Kor, the Slime Queen , Fhanhorn , and Bhaa are the only mobs that have a death animation upon defeat. Kor, Bhaa, and Fhanhorn are the only mobs that have a spawn animation. Kor will not automatically despawn if it is flung into the void around its battle area, awarding no rewards and forcing the player to despawn Kor manually. Kor's health is 9,001, a reference to the \"Over 9,000!\" meme from the Dragon Ball franchise in which the character Vegeta says the phrase, \"It's Over 9,000!\" (source?) There used to be a glitch where the cooldown timer would reset after defeating the Slime King . Kor has the second longest cooldown timer, the first being Bhaa with a cooldown of 2 hours. The boss is featured in the luxury egg sculpture . Kor was (was? which boss is currently the slowest?) the slowest boss in Islands in terms of speed. Like Bhaa, Kor does not have any physical weaknesses. Prior to September 18, 2021 , the summon cooldown of Kor cannot be bypassed with tokens . Like Fhanhorn and the Slime Queen, a death sound is played upon Kor's defeat.  Gallery [ ]"

It's dropped by the Wizard Boss on Wizard Island with a 0.5% chance. This weapon is in the storm class.  Obtaining [ ]  Mob drop [ ]  The lightning scepter has a 0.5% chance of being dropped by the Wizard Boss .  Behavior [ ]  The lightning scepter is a magic weapon, instead of firing a slow moving ball projectile like other magic weapon, the lightning sceptre fires arcs of lightning which travel much faster and is even comparable to arrows in travel speed, a single bolt can deal damage to the same target multiple times if the hitboxes collide long enough and can hit multiple targets, it deals knockback, and click to use. The range of a lightning scepter is 5-6 blocks. It is in the storm class.  Attacking [ ]  Item Base Damage DPS (regular) Type Lightning Scepter 6 HP ? HP Magic  History [ ]  April 7, 2021 Added Staff of Lightning, however it was unimplemented as of then. April 10, 2021 Renamed the \"Staff of Lightning\" to the \"Static Scepter\", and added it as a drop from the Wizard Boss . September 11, 2021 Fixed a bug that prevented players from moving when using a static scepter. Changed the drop chance from 3% to 0.5%. December 10, 2021 Fixed a bug that caused the static scepters to spawn multiple arcs of lightning. April 22, 2022 The static scepters can now be placed in tool stands . ? Correctly fixed the bug that caused the static scepter to spawn multiple arcs of lightning. September 17, 2022 Buffed the static scepter's damage from 2 to 8 HP. The static scepters are now in the storm class. September 24, 2022 Nerfed the static scepter's damage from 8 to 5 HP. Modified the static scepter\u2019s hit register. November 11, 2022 Renamed the \"Static Scepter\" to the \"Lightning Scepter\". The lightning scepter is changed from firing continuously to a single bolt being fired from the staff, making it more similar to other magic weapons .  Trivia [ ]  The hitboxes of this weapon aren't accurate. The lightning scepter wasn't released with most of the other content in the April 4, 2021 update. Instead, it was released in a minor update 3 days later. It was originally called the Staff of Lightning and the Static Scepter. This is the first ranged weapon with the ability to deal critical hits. There used to be a bug in which players could not move while using the lightning scepter. This has since been patched. This weapon was tied for the lowest damage per hit in the game with the maple shield before the remake on November 11, 2022 . The lightning scepter was used to be the fastest attacking weapon above the rageblade before the remake on November 11, 2022 . It is the first weapon that can be directly dropped from a mob , and the first weapon to be dropped from a boss . The Wizard Boss\u2019s static attack is similar to this weapon's original attack, the only difference being the color of the rays (Light blue/cyan).  Gallery [ ]"

Spooking turkeys will not grant any Animal Care XP nor Fhanhorn tokens .  Fhanhorn [ ]  Fhanhorn can be spawned on the third major island of the Maple Isles, which can be traveled to by talking to Don after completing Bailey 's and Emma 's questlines. It has a summon cooldown at 60 minutes; 1 hour. It also can be summoned without any Combat level requirement. It currently has no token .  Unlike the Slime King , Kor , the Wizard Boss , and Bhaa as regular bosses with summon cooldowns , Fhanhorn 's summon cooldown currently cannot be bypassed with tokens , unless other than forcing players to wait for 60 minutes; 1 hour and able to re-summon it. It also currently doesn't have its own token , even with its summoning UI while on cooldown since the October 28, 2022 update.  Villagers [ ]  First Isle [ ]  First Isle Villagers Don Bailey Kontos  Bailey [ ]  Bailey is a villager located near the island spawn who, upon first interaction, will give the player a maple workbench . The player can complete quests for her to progress through the Maple Isles questline and earn other rewards from her, such as a sap boiler and a syrup bottler . She hosts a shop where players can sell pancakes and purchase various furniture blocks.  Kontos [ ]  Kontos is a villager who rewards the player with a turkey trophy after defeating Fhanhorn for the first time. He is located on the first island near the bridge that connects the second island.  Second Isle [ ]  Second Isle Villagers Emma Don  Emma [ ]  Emma is a villager located behind the gate on the second island, which can only be unlocked after completing Bailey's questline. Like Bailey, she also hands out quests that the player can complete to progress to Fhanhorn's arena. She sells raspberry seeds and turkey spawn eggs and buys raspberries and berry pancakes , although Bailey also buys berry pancakes for the same price.  Don [ ]  Don appears in two locations: near the island spawn and on a pier on the second island. Interacting with her near spawn will teleport the player back to the Hub . Although the player can interact with her on the second island, she will only provide the final questline once the player has finished Emma's. After completing her quest, she grants the player access to Fhanhorn's arena on the third island.  Music [ ]  Name Audio Artist Fall in the Sky https://robloxislands.fandom.com/wiki/File:Fall_in_the_Sky.ogg Micah Fischer  History [ ]  November 20, 2020 Added a floating maple tree, a teaser for Turkey Island. December 18, 2020 Added Turkey Island. January 4, 2021 Removed all terrain and content from the island. November 27, 2021 Re-added terrain and content to the island. Officially named the island the \"Maple Isles\". Added turkeys on the Maple Isles. Added Fhanhorn on the Maple Isles. July 16, 2022 Replaced the Maple Island portal with Don now transporting the player to and from the Hub .  Trivia [ ]  Prior to November 27, 2021 , everything except the terrain was removed on January 4, 2021 , it was re-added as the Maple Isles on November 27, 2021 . The Maple Isles is the first location to be a cluster of islands, the second being the Void Isles . There is a bug where the gate to the Second Isle will still be there even after the player finished Bailey 's questline. This can be fixed by talking to Kontos or Bailey . The Maple Isles is the second permanent island that doesn't have any hostile mob , with the first being Spirit Island . Fhanhorn was the first and only boss of the Maple Isles in Islands whose summon cooldown currently cannot be bypassed with tokens during it has no token and no hostile mobs , unless forced players to wait for 60 minutes; 1 hour and able to re-summon it. Due to the Maple Isles has no hostile mobs , it doesn't have its own token to bypass 1-hour cooldown. Since the October 28, 2022 update, it doesn't have any token requirement on its summoning UI while on cooldown. Unlike most bosses with the \" Failed to Summon \" notification, if a player attempts to summon Fhanhorn while on cooldown during it has no token , nothing happens. It was the first and only boss of the Maple Isles in Islands that doesn't have the \" Failed to Summon \" notification.  Gallery [ ]"

We're experimenting several ways to solve this problem; for now, we need to lower the item limit to keep servers in a healthy state. VIP servers still have the 80 item limit -- this change only applies to public servers.

We've identified an issue where joining a server with a large island (40,000+ blocks) could crash the server if not enough memory is available. This results in the large island's data being corrupted (lots of missing blocks). As a temporary fix, we now deny large islands from joining a server if it will cause a crash. This means players with large islands may need to join several different servers until they are able to load-in.  We're working on ways we can avoid this type of restriction for large islands. For the time being, players with large islands are recommended to either join non-full servers or reserve a VIP server. We've also lowered the max player count to 22. We're hoping this lowered limit is only temporary.

Mounts can be selected by pressing the button on the left and can be equipped by pressing the \"C\" key (PC only) or by pressing the button next to the backpack button. Players cannot change mounts while on one. Mounts will automatically be dismounted when the player takes any damage from mobs , with the exception of animal mounts.  Methods of obtaining [ ]  Quests [ ]  Broom (Sweep the Floor) Witch's Broom (The Wicked Witch)  Animals [ ]  Not boosted [ ]  Cow Sheep Pig Chicken Turkey  With boosts [ ]  Duck Yak Horse Vulture  Function [ ]  When mounted, most mounts will give a speed boost that lasts until the player dismounts it, and only one gives a jump boost.  Mounts [ ]  Animal mounts [ ]  Full-grown animals can be mounted. Some animal mounts will give the player a speed boost and only one gives the player a jump boost.

Not boosted [ ]  With boosts [ ]  Trivia [ ]  Prior to the patch on October 16, 2022 , mounts had a 5 second cooldown on mounting when receiving any damage. Horse and vulture are the only animal mounts that don't have or indicate the status effect icon if players mount them due to their permanent boosts. Turkey is the first and only animal mount that don't have any animation if a player mounts it. Horse is the fastest animal mount in Islands if a player mounts it, even faster when consuming chili peppers , potato and duck egg scrambles , and sweet rice desserts . Its permanent speed boost was likely 100%. Horse is the first and only animal mount in Islands that grants a jump boost. if a player mounts it. Its permanent jump boost was likely 50%. Horse, turkey, and vulture are the only animal mounts able to turn around while jumping and mounting. They are also the only animals that don't have a looking animation. This was likely can be done if camera lock or first-person view. If the player attempts to use another mount when already on a mount, the notification says: \" Already on a mount - You are already on a mount. \".  Gallery [ ]"

Poison damage [ ]  There is a 20% - 40% chance that a mob will take poison damage after being hit. 8 - 15 damage will be dealt every 0.3 seconds 11 times, resulting in 88 - 165 additional damage points dealt.  Throwing [ ]  The noxious stinger can be thrown to attack mobs out of the player's reach by holding left click. This feature has a cooldown of 2 seconds.  History [ ]  March 17, 2023 Added noxious stingers.  Trivia [ ]  It is the first and only spear weapon in Islands . It is the third-strongest weapon in the game, with the second being the serpent's bane and the strongest being the reaper's scythe . When lagging, noxious stingers can make hostile mobs \"fly\". This is because the poison damage is being registered as having knockback. The Skorp Stinger from BedWars is based off this weapon.  This weapon is considered to be the best weapon by the community, due to it's high attack power and ranged ability.  It is the strongest Light Melee weapon."

Trivia [ ]  If a palm tree is chopped down while having coconuts on it, it will only drop the sapling and not any of the coconuts. During the release of the Godzilla vs. Kong event, there was a glitch where players were able to chop down the palm trees on Skull Island , rendering the quest to collect 10 coconuts for Bosco to be very difficult. However, this was later patched around half an hour later. There was another bug that made palm trees unable to drop palm tree saplings when players harvested coconuts . This was shortly fixed in the same patch mentioned above. Before the official release of palm trees on March 19, 2021 , large palm trees can be found on Desert Island . However, players are unable to interact with them. Before the May 21, 2021 update, palm trees were only able to be grown on grass . The palm tree is the only tree that can be grown on anything other than grass .  Gallery [ ]"

Trivia [ ]  Before the March 13, 2021 update, Petur only offered to buy 5 different food items with one hot offer. After the update, most food items could be sold anytime and 5 - 6 hot offers would alternate every 24 hours. Hot offers used to simply be a higher price the food sells for. Now, the prices vary and are around a certain range. From January 8, 2022 to January 15, 2022 , all food prices were raised by x1.5. The industrial merchant teleseller cannot sell things to Petur due to his changing prices. Since the November 13, 2021 update, any newer food items are currently cannot be sold to Petur, except pineapple pizzas . The model of Petur is similar to the model of the Baker kit from Bedwars ."

    "content": "Pig Pig Muddy Piggy Bank Behavior Passive Location Player's Island  The pig is a small animal and passive mob that can be spawned using a pig spawn egg , which can be bought from Taliyah at level 31 Animal Care .  It is the third animal passive mob in Islands .  Uses [ ]  Pigs can dig up a truffle from a tree when they're not hungry. They may also dig up a white truffle if your animal care level is high enough and your pig is happy. However, if the pig is hungry, it will eat the truffle instead. This can be avoided by placing truffle barrels or industrial truffle barrels on the ground. Pigs leave behind dirt piles by the trees where they can dig up the truffles, removing the hole grants you 1 grass block.  Animal Skin [ ]  A pig's skin can be changed to the Piggy Bank skin once the player buys its animal skin for 399 Robux .  Ornaments [ ]  Petting, feeding, or taking a truffle from a pig had a 0.1% chance of rewarding a pig ornament .  Behavior [ ]  Like all animals, the pig can breed. They can be lured and fed with carrots , but will have avocado toast , jam sandwich , or starfruit cake as their favorite food. If they fall into the void, they will respawn at the player's spawn point.  Feeding a pig will increase its food and friendliness level. The food level is necessary to keep above 20% or the pig will start losing happiness.  A wooden trough , metal trough , or automated trough can be used to feed pigs.  Like other animals , if no troughs are in its vicinity, it will eat from a grass block , but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.  Mounting [ ]  Pigs can be mounted by the player (requires Level 8 Animal Care ) through the inspection menu, located next to the \"Sell Animal\" button.  A pig can be ridden anywhere within your server. To get off, press the dismount button on the right of the screen. You can use Tools / Weapons while mounting.  When you dismount the animal when not in your own Players\u2019 Island, the pig will teleport to the player's spawn point.  Mounting a pig does not grant any boosts.  History [ ]  February 5, 2021 Added pigs. Introduced where pigs are now able to eat grass blocks if no troughs are nearby. February 19, 2021 Pigs can now be mounted. February 26, 2021 Pigs now count as small animals instead of large animals. April 24, 2021 Added piggy bank skin. Introduced where pigs no longer become muddy when sleeping on mud piles . December 18, 2021 Feeding, petting, or taking a truffle from a pig now has a 0.1% chance of rewarding a pig ornament . January 15, 2022 Feeding, petting, or taking a truffle from a pig can no longer reward a pig ornament. February 17, 2023 Pigs can now gather truffles to industrial truffle barrels .  Trivia [ ]  There used to be a typo in its description, reading \"They will it eat,\" but this has since been corrected to \"They will eat it.\" Even though it states they will dig truffles from a tree, they can dig truffles without trees. This was one of the two animals to get a banner styled after the animal. Like all other animals, pigs may eat from a grass block instead of from troughs, but doing so will not replenish their hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP. This can be done if no troughs are nearby. The eating sound of pigs is reduced when eating grass blocks. Pigs are the second-shortest animal model, the first-shortest being chickens . Pigs can get stuck in any non-full block such as slab or tree . Since the April 24, 2021 update, pigs may still perform the animation to remove mud despite being unable to become muddy. Pigs share many things with other animals . Pigs share the same eating sound as cows , sheep , turkeys , yaks , and horses . Pigs have the same animations as cows, sheep, and yaks. Pigs have the same eye model as cows, sheep, chickens, frogs , and rabbits . Pigs and horses have the least amount of favorite foods . Pigs rewards to most amount of Animal Care XP, with the second being sheep.  Gallery [ ]"

The currency used by the native pirates are doubloons .  Unlike most islands, Pirate Island cannot be accessed through a portal and only through interacting with Hannah in the Hub , who can be found near the Hub Lake . Interacting with Hannah on Pirate Island will teleport the player back to the Hub spawn.  This island currently has no boss .  Resources [ ]  Ores [ ]  The only ore on Pirate Island are obsidian rocks , spawning on the edges of the volcano.  Travelling [ ]  Pirate Island has no portals, but instead, Hannah sends the player from Pirate Island to the Hub and vice-versa.  Fishing [ ]  Aside from the normal group of fish , puffer fish and sharks can also exclusively be caught in the bodies of water .  Villagers [ ]  Main area [ ]  Main Area Villagers Evans Ruby Davey Terri Odlum The main area of Pirate Island is where most of the pirates are. Davey and Terri are on the left side from the entrance while Ruby , Evans , and Odlum are on the right.  Hannah [ ]  Docks Villagers Hannah  Hannah can be found near the spawn-point of Pirate Island, on the docks near the main area.  Mobs [ ]  Hostile mobs [ ]  There are two hostile mobs on Pirate Island: bandits and angry crabs . The bandits can be found in the jungle area of the island while the angry crabs spawn in the pirate cove .  Terrain [ ]  Jungle [ ]  Jungle Resources Kiwi Mobs Bandit The jungle covers the majority of Pirate Island and is where bandits spawn. There are also kiwi trees and palm trees that can be found in and around the jungle. While the kiwi trees grow kiwis that can be picked, the palm trees do not serve any purpose other than being decoration.  Volcano [ ]  Volcano Resources Obsidian Mobs Bandit The volcano is located at the center of the island, and abundant obsidian rocks spawn in the surroundings. Lava can be found in the crater of the volcano, but it acts just as a neon orange floor due to the fact that it doesn't deal damage to the player.  Pirate Cove [ ]  Pirate Cove Mobs Angry Crab Fish Shark Pufferfish The pirate cove offers an area to fish not only for regular fish, but also for sharks and puffer fish . The beaches of the cove are where angry crabs spawn.  History [ ]  July 17, 2021 Added Pirate Island. November 16, 2021 Fixed lighting issues of Pirate Island's edges.  Trivia [ ]  Despite lava being added in the September 18, 2021 update and swimming in any lava pool in the Underworld deals damage to the player, the lava in the Volcano is still solid and does not harm the player. This is the second permanent island that doesn't have a boss , with the first being Spirit Island . If player stands on top of a certain patch of lava material surrounding the volcano, the sky will turn to night."

Each player has their own island, where they can freely build and interact with blocks and items. A maximum of 80,000 blocks can be placed on a player's island.  Traveling [ ]  Players can access their island by entering the large portal in the Hub or by clicking the \"Home\" button at any time on the right of the screen. Players may access other players' islands if they have been directly invited to one by the owner of the island or by choosing to visit a published island through the explore menu or a join code . The owner of an island can toggle whether another player may place, break, or interact with blocks through the visitor permissions UI .  Owners of the pro gamepass may choose to publish their island, which broadcasts their island on the explore menu . A maximum of 30 players may be on a player's island at once.  Save slots [ ]  A player has the option to start a new save slot by selecting the My Profiles button on the left side of their screen. Each save slot has its own island, skill level , wallet , and inventory , meaning that data from other save slots cannot be directly transferred to another. Players have the choice to create a co-op save slot , which allows up to seven different players with owner permissions to collaborate on an island.  Resetting [ ]  A player can choose to reset their island once every two days by typing \"/reset\" in the chat. Resetting a player island erases all existing blocks , items , and mobs on the island, but allows the player to retain their wallet , skill levels , and all blocks and items in their inventory and hotbar .  Villagers [ ]  Different villagers will visit the player's island during specific seasons or events . The owner of the island can ask villagers to leave their island by choosing [Ask to leave Island] when interacting with them. Non-seasonal villagers will not leave the player's island unless requested so. The following villagers may appear on the player's island, each at different times with a different purpose:  Image Villager Appearance time Purpose Cletus Spring , summer [ 1 ] , fall Buys and sells seasonal crops Fulco Summer , winter [ 2 ] Sells fertile roses Davey 50% chance on any day Offers a free treasure map Taliyah April 10, 2021 , April 9, 2022 Offered a free Islands anniversary cake in celebration of Islands' 1 year anniversary on April 10, 2021, and a free Islands second anniversary cake in celebration of the 2 year anniversary on April 9, 2022 .

Count: 80 by machine or totem(some totem max drop are 250); 30 by player. Duration: 2 minutes (120 seconds).  Animal Care level Large animal limit Small animal limit Level 1 2 2 Level 10 3 Level 20 4 3 Level 30 4 Level 40 5 5 Level 60 6 6 Level 80 7 7  Trivia [ ]  The block limit for player islands was changed a couple of times; the November 7, 2020 update increased the limit from 50,000 blocks to 70,000 blocks, and the February 5, 2021 update increased it to the current amount of 80,000. Due to the horizontal build limit of 333 blocks from bedrock , players are unable to reach another player's island via building. If the player's island is too big for a server, they will be kicked from the game with a message reading, \" Your island is too big for this server. Please join a different one. \" This was the original reason why private servers are free for Islands . Player islands that were created before the July 17, 2020 update started with a workbench tier 1 instead of a workbench . The plow that is found next to the patch of wheat from an island creation is held by an item port to prevent it from despawning. Villagers and mobs are able to sit on certain furniture blocks but are unable to get out on their own. Breaking the furniture block is the only way to release them. The third version of the player's island can be seen on the loading screen in blocky form. The animal limit of players is actually 7 large and 7 small instead of the 12 large and 12 small stated in the Animal Care roadmap. When totems and machines are almost at the edge the player's islands(X: 145 blocks Y: 60 blocks[X is direction of the portal face]), they do not produce anything."

Crafting [ ]  Name Recipe Crafting station Required skill Blueprint required Rageblade 100 Red Bronze Ingot 20 Maple Wood Anvil Level 60 Light Melee  Behavior [ ]  Attacking [ ]  At level 1 Light Melee , the Rageblade deals a base damage of 13 HP and can be swung every 0.5 seconds at default. It has the ability to damage multiple mobs in one swing and deals large knockback. There's also a small chance of landing a critical hit when using this weapon, meaning the attack will deal an extra 7 HP of damage. Its damage can be increased by leveling up the Light Melee skill and it is in the slashing class.  Like other melee weapon , only one player can hit damage in each hostile mob. Multiple players cannot hit damage together.  Rage effect [ ]  After 15 consecutive hits to a player, hostile mob , or passive mob , the rageblade will turn red and start to emit flame particles. The player can swing the rageblade from 2 swings per second to 4.5 swings per second in proportion to its redness.  History [ ]  October 3, 2020 Added rageblades.

Trivia [ ]  It is possible to \"fly\" on some mobs such as the buffalkor or skorps by jumping on one and continuously attacking it. This is due to the combination of the rageblade's knockback and fast attack speed and the mobs' large hitbox. The old model of the rageblade resembles a katana , a type of sword from ancient Japan . The in-game description for the rageblade is a quote by Mario Andretti , an Italian racer. Prior to November 11, 2022 , the rageblade was the second-fastest weapon , the fastest being the lightning scepter . This was the second weapon to have an ability, the first being the azarathian longbow . The rageblade model is equivalent to the Rageblade model in BedWars ."

    "content": "Resource Island Copper Gold Oil Resources Oil Fuel Gold Ore Copper Ore A resource island is an island that is randomly located around the player's island , spawned by resource deeds . There are three different types of deposits that may spawn on resource islands: copper , gold , and oil .  Resource islands act as an extension of the main player island and may spawn rocks , tall grass , and flowers . A resource island cannot be spawned if the player has reached the block limit of 80,000 or the resource island limit (of any kind) of 15.  Copper resource islands [ ]  Copper resource islands can be spawned using copper resource deeds , with one copper deposit available per island.  Prior to the June 3, 2022 update, one copper resource island would naturally spawn without any necessary prerequisites but will only reach the limit of two once the player had a workbench tier 3 placed on their island.  Gold resource islands [ ]  Gold resource islands can be spawned using gold resource deeds , with one gold deposit available per island.  Prior to the June 3, 2022 update, up to two existing gold resource islands would naturally spawn once the player had two existing copper resource islands.  Oil resource islands [ ]  Oil resource islands can be spawned using oil resource deeds , with one temporary oil deposit capable of producing 5,000 units of oil fuel available per island.  Prior to the June 3, 2022 update, up to two existing oil resource islands would naturally spawn once the player had a workbench tier 4 placed on their island.  Trivia [ ]  Resource islands used to spawn further away from the player's island , but they were later changed to spawn closer to it. From the addition of oil resource islands on August 15, 2021 to June 3, 2022 , copper and gold resource islands would not spawn correctly if the player had placed a workbench tier 4 on their island as the game did not register it as a workbench tier 3 , thus causing the game to think that the requirement for copper deposits to spawn had not been reached. This could've been fixed by breaking the placed workbench tier 4 and placing a workbench tier 3 until a new deposit spawns. At the release of the September 25, 2021 update, there was a bug that caused the possibility of a third copper resource island to spawn, disregarding the previous limit of 2. Before the June 3, 2022 update was released, resource islands naturally spawned around the player's island with certain prerequisites and did not need to be spawned with deeds ."

Spirit saplings will not grow when planted next to the machine due to the hitbox being bigger. Spirit saplings also disappear when placed by the machine if a block is on the left or right side of the \"forks\"."

    "content": "Sheep Sheep Sheared Birthday Behavior Passive Location Player's Island  A sheep is a large passive mob that can be spawned using a sheep spawn egg once the player is level 21 in Animal Care . It can grow up into adult sheep after roughly 12 hours.  It is the second animal passive mob in Islands .  Obtaining [ ]  Sheep are obtainable by buying sheep spawn eggs at Taliyah's store at level 21 in Animal Care.  Animal skin [ ]  A sheep's skin can be changed to the birthday skin if the player bought it for 399 Robux .  Interaction [ ]  Shearing [ ]  Using shears , players can shear a sheep for wool . Note: unlike the bucket , players do not lose the shears after using them. Wool blocks resemble a snow block and can be placed and used as a building or decoration block . Once players are level 24 in Animal Care, the cloth loom , which turns wool to cloth , is unlocked. Wool and cloth can be sold to Taliyah respectively for 120 and 350 coins. When a sheep's coat grows, it will walk to a scratching post and scratch it off, leaving one wool.  Feeding [ ]  Sheep can be fed approximately every 90-100 seconds (multiple times if its hunger is sufficiently depleted). Sheep eat potatoes , but will also each have its own favorite foods. The foods a sheep can have as their favorites are apple pie , lemon bread , candy apple , lemon puff , orange cake , and orange honeycomb . Feeding a sheep one of their favorite foods will increase the amount of wool the fed sheep produces, as well as increase the happiness/friendship status of the sheep.  A wooden , metal trough , or automated trough can also be used to feed a sheep.  Like other animals , if no troughs are in its vicinity, it will eat from a grass block , but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.  Mounting [ ]  A sheep can be mounted using the inspection menu. When players level 8 in animal care, they can ride a sheep to anywhere when mounting including the hub, mob islands etc. To get off, press the dismount button on the right of the screen. Players can use tools / weapons when mounting. If a player falls in the void when riding, their animal will respawn. If a player dismounts their animal in other people's island or a mob island, it will respawn in their base. Mounting a sheep does not grant any boosts.  History [ ]  January 22, 2021 Added sheep. Introduced where sheep are now able to eat grass blocks if no troughs are nearby. January 25, 2021 Sheep fall asleep much later in the day. Sheep can no longer be fed while asleep. February 19, 2021 Added birthday sheep skin. Sheep can now be mounted. February 26, 2021 The birthday sheep skin is made unobtainable.  Trivia [ ]  Sheep are the first and only animal that when harvested directly gives a block. Like all other animals, sheep may eat from a grass block instead of from troughs, but doing so will not replenish their hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP. This can be done if no troughs are nearby. The eating sound of sheep is reduced when eating a grass block. Sheep are the second animal passive mob in Islands , the first being cows . Sheep share many things with other animals . Sheep share the same eating sound as cows, pigs , turkey , yaks , and horses . Sheep have the same animations as cows, pigs, and yaks. Sheep have the same eye model as cows, pigs, chickens , frogs , and rabbits . Sheep are able to move with the sleeping animation, but this can be fixed by mounting and dismounting them. The hitbox of players is slightly increased when mounting a sheep. Sheep have the highest number of favorite foods , with the second being chickens and ducks ."

    "content": "Skill levels , also known as XP levels, is a feature that was added in the January 22, 2021 update. Players can gain XP towards different categories by doing different actions. Upon obtaining a sufficient amount of XP, players may level up and obtain access to new villager trades or crafting recipes. The amount of XP needed to gain a level increases with every level-up.  Every day, there is a daily bonus that quadruples XP gain until a certain amount is reached, this is called your Daily Bonus. The max amount required to finish the daily bonus scales with the level, meaning that higher levels have a higher daily bonus. Upon the end of your Daily Bonus you will not receive its boost. But at the start of each new day it will reset for you to continue using your Daily Bonus. To increase the boost amount, players can also pay 99 Robux for a 50% boost only on one skill, another skill boost would cost another 99 Robux.  Skills are divided into 3 groups differentiated by color: brown, green and red. Brown skills are related to gathering resources/coins, greens are aimed at the production of goods and reds train mostly everything related to combat.

Prior to February 3, 2023 , it was 99. The XP and experience orb particles will still be given even if the player has maxed out their skill levels. The \"4x daily bonus\" will be unavailable and decreased to \"0/0\". However, the effect of Experience Boost will still affect the amount received of XP. If the player receives 15 XP or less, the amount received of XP will not appear and nothing happens. If the player receives 18 XP or more, the amount received of XP will still appear. However, the amount displayed of XP will be decreased to 20%, 17.5%, 15%, 12.5%, and then 10%. 10% is the minimum amount displayed of XP when receives 501 XP or more. Despite being a \"4x daily bonus\", the bonus is not always 4x the original amount. The background image of the error message appearing if the player doesn't have the required level to use and item or block used to have a picture from Minecraft Dungeons . This was later changed to the November 1, 2020 update banner. The Economy and Forging are the only two skills that don't have any base stats. Prior to November 13, 2021 , the Cooking skill didn't have a base stat."

It was where the Kong quests were located. It was accessed by it's portal in the Hub or by pressing the Kong event button, found on the right of a player's screen.  Resources [ ]  Only two resources could have been found on Skull Island :  Palm Tree Coconuts  Mobs [ ]  The only \"mob\" found on this island was Kong, who just walked around the island. Kong stopped to drink occasionally, but players were never able to go on him, because he was not a functional object. As he was not a hostile mob, he was immune to any form of weapon damage and had no collision.  Villagers [ ]  Bosco gave quests during the event rewarding the player with the Kong Trophy , Kong's Axe , and the Kong Badge .  Terrain [ ]  Skull River [ ]  A river flows around the middle of the island which Kong walks in, it wasn't deep enough to swim in and didn't hold any Fish .  Bone Piles [ ]  There are 8 bone piles scattered around the island they look exactly like the bones on Desert Island , Bosco's has a quest to study 5 of them. Note: There are bigger bone formations that cannot be studied .  Skull Mountain [ ]  A giant skull can be found atop a mountain to the right of spawn, Bosco asks player's to retrieve his pouch from it.  Mountains [ ]  There are 5 mountains scattered about the island 3 of which have binoculars on them, 1 for the skull and 1 that is useless and extremely hard to climb.  Trivia [ ]  There was originally a glitch that allowed Palm Trees to be chopped down for Oak Wood , but they never respawned. This was fixed minutes after it was found. During the event, exploiters using fly or teleport hacks were rampant. They would teleport and harvest coconuts from trees as soon as they spawned in order to farm saplings. The bone piles are based on the remains of Kong's Family and relatives killed by the Skullcrawlers ."

lower half of a block's side surface creates a bottom slab. Placing a slab on the underside of a block or on the top half of the side surface creates a top slab. Two slabs cannot be placed in the same block.  Slabs cannot be oriented vertically.  History [ ]  May 26, 2020 Added oak , pine , birch , maple , stone brick , and brick slabs. August 2, 2020 Added hickory slabs. August 9, 2020 Added red sandstone and red sandstone brick slabs. April 4, 2021 Added slate , slate brick , marble , aquamarine , and aquamarine brick slabs. April 24, 2021 Added sandstone and sandstone brick slabs. May 8, 2021 Added marble brick slabs. Changed the texture of oak, pine, birch, maple, hickory, red sandstone brick, and aquamarine brick slabs. May 21, 2021 Reverted modified slab textures. Renamed prismarine slabs to aquamarine slabs. June 4, 2021 Added smooth sandstone , smooth sandstone brick , smooth red sandstone , smooth red sandstone brick , smooth aquamarine , and smooth aquamarine brick slabs. June 30, 2021 Added spirit slabs. March 6, 2022 Added andesite , andesite brick , diorite , diorite brick , granite , and granite brick slabs. March 6, 2022 Added basalt and basalt brick slabs. July 16, 2022 Added mossy , cobblestone , and mossy cobblestone slabs. August 27, 2022 Added void stone , void stone cobble , void stone polished , void stone brick , void stone tiled , and void stone carved slabs. November 25, 2022 Added colored solid and pastel slabs. January 20, 2023 Added cherry blossom slabs.  Trivia [ ]  Before the May 21, 2021 update, aquamarine slabs were incorrectly titled as prismarine slabs. Andesite , diorite , granite , and basalt slabs are placed in the wrong slab category in the crafting UI. All slabs added after the July 16, 2022 update are not included under the three main slab categories; instead, they are present in their own crafting box. Animals cannot jump over slabs and may instead get stuck in them."

Obtaining [ ]  Crafting [ ]  Name Recipe Crafting station Slime Queen's Scepter 1 Spellbook 100 Gold Ingot 50 Pink Slime Ball 10 Pink Slime Crystal Anvil  Attacking [ ]  Casting [ ]  At level 1 Magic , shots from the Slime Queen's scepter deal a base damage of 46 HP. The shots are fired horizontally in the direction the player is facing, and its damage can be increased by leveling up the Magic skill. If a shot hits a mob , it will heal the player by 5% every 1 second.  Charging [ ]  Charging a shot will increase the amount of damage dealt by 1.35x at full charge. This additional damage can be increased by leveling up the Magic skill and does not affect the amount of health healed by the projectiles.  Health drain [ ]  After three successful fully charged hits, the Slime Queen's scepter will target the closest mob and drain 20 HP five times at a fast rate, dealing a total of 100 HP of damage. The amount of hits needed to perform this ability is depicted by small pink crystals above the player's health bar. The amount of damage dealt can be increased by the player's Magic level.  History [ ]  July 23, 2022 Added the Slime Queen's scepter. August 6, 2022 Buffed Slime Queen's scepter damage from 40 to 50.

September 24, 2022 Slime Queen's scepters are now in the ethereal class. Fixed the bug where Slime Queen's scepters would not heal the player when damaging a mob. October 8, 2022 The Slime Queen's scepter now can heal the player again when damaging a mob. October 15, 2022 Buffed Slime Queen's scepter damage from 40 to 46.  Trivia [ ]  As of September 17, 2022 , the Slime Queen's scepter is the only Magic weapon that can be charged. Due to a bug after the health drain, the Slime Queen's scepter triggers the charging meter. The Slime Queen's scepters and the spellbooks are the only two magic weapons that can be crafted without a Magic level requirement. Since the September 24, 2022 update, the health drain of the Slime Queen's scepter  actually deals quake damage instead of ethereal damage. As such, the health drain of the Slime Queen's scepter grants the vulnerability effect to a mob and cannot heal the player. This effect was added in the December 23, 2022 update."

Removed the spellbook's charging ability. Spellbooks are now an inferno class. October 1, 2022 Changed the model of spellbooks. October 8, 2022 Spellbooks, along with all other Inferno Weapons , give enemies the burning effect.  Trivia [ ]  The spellbook used to use the tidal spellbook's model from July 25, 2020 - October 1, 2022 before being changed to a new one on July 25, 2020 when the aforementioned weapon was released. The spellbook's animation used to be a \"two hand shove\" animation. However, it was changed to the melee swing animation after the March 19, 2021 update. Despite wizard lizards using spellbooks, they continue to use the two hand shove animation instead of the melee swing animation. Despite exploding upon disappearing, fireballs shot from spellbooks don't deal AOE damage. The spellbook's projectiles can collide with a wizard lizard's projectile, causing one or both projectiles to explode mid-path. The spellbook can fire through terrain and island parts, but cannot fire through game-generated structures or water. The angle the fireball launches is slightly delayed from the player's actual rotation, making shots inaccurate if the player is moving their camera very quickly. Spellbooks do not function correctly on private servers, as well as tidal spellbooks and ruby staffs . Spellbooks and Slime Queen's scepters are the only magic weapons that can be crafted without a Magic level requirement."

]  Stairs are used as a way for players to ascend without jumping.  Stairs can be placed either upright or upside down. Pointing the cursor at the bottom half of a vertical block face will place the stair upright, while pointing it at the top half of a vertical block face will place it upside down.  Despite their appearance, stairs have an inclined plane hitbox.  Dropped items can slide on tilted surfaces, this can make stairs useful for automation as a method of item transportation.  Trivia [ ]  Before the May 21, 2021 update, aquamarine stairs were incorrectly titled as prismarine stairs. Until March 25, 2022 , andesite , diorite , and granite stairs were placed in the wrong stair category in the crafting UI. From March 6, 2022 to March 25, 2022, marble , aquamarine , sandstone , and red sandstone stairs were removed from the crafting UI in the workbench tier 2 , workbench tier 3 , and workbench tier 4 by mistake. However, aquamarine stairs are still uncraftable. Since the March 25, 2022 update, smooth sandstone and smooth red sandstone stairs are able to be crafted in both stair categories instead of solely the brick/smooth stair category. All stairs added after the July 16, 2022 update are not included under the three main stair categories; instead, they are present in their own crafting box."

Trivia [ ]  Like pineapples , although the existence of oily starfruit in the game's code implies that it gets oily on conveyors , starfruit cannot get oily. Starfruit (also called 'carambola'), is a tree ( Averrhoa carambola ) in real life rather than a patch growing on the ground in Islands . Also, the starfruit model in-game is only a slice of a real carambola rather than the entire fruit. Upon its release, starfruit weren't edible. This was changed in the July 17, 2020 update."

The captain\u2019s rapier is a light melee weapon in the piercing classes.  Obtaining [ ]  Treasure chest [ ]  Opening a treasure chest has a 0.25% chance of rewarding the captain's rapier, having a rarity of 'mythic'.  Behavior [ ]  Attacking [ ]  At Light Melee level 1, the captain's rapier deals a base damage of 30 HP and can be swung every 0.5 seconds. It has the ability to damage multiple mobs in one swing and deals very high knockback. There's also a small chance of landing a critical hit when using this weapon, meaning the attack will deal an extra 15 HP of damage. Its damage can be increased by leveling up the Light Melee skill and it is in the piercing classes.  Looting [ ]  Upon defeating a mob, the captain's rapier increases the chance of mob drops by 20% of its original value, meaning it multiplies the drop rate of items from mobs by 1.2x. For example, an item with a 0.35% drop chance will now have a 0.42% chance of dropping. Items with a 100% drop rate will be increased to 120%, meaning that it has a guaranteed chance of dropping one and an additional 20% chance of dropping another.  Its looting bonus can be stacked with the luck effect granted from consuming a dragon roll and blueberry cookie , allowing a maximum increase of 80%, or 1.8x, to be applied to a mob drop.

    "content": "A totem is used to automatically farm crops or minerals . Each totem has a 1x3x1 hitbox and can be purchased from Arius in the Hub using coins .  Totems can store items; once their storage is full, they will stop collecting items until the player empties them. When placed next to a conveyor , totems will automatically drop its items onto it to be transported to industrial machines . A totem is disabled if it within 10 blocks of a totem disabler .  Crop Totems [ ]  Crop totems collect and replant crops in a 3-block radius but do not produce additional seeds . They have 6 slots, each able to hold one crop. Once full, the totem will not harvest or replant crops until the player empties it. At level 1, a crop totem takes 30 seconds to harvest one crop and an additional 30 seconds to drop it onto a conveyor . They grant Farming XP despite the absence of XP particles.  Dispensed tomatoes , potatoes , carrots , and onions become oily , requiring washing in a washing station or an industrial washing station before it can be used or sold.  Cacti , chili peppers , rice , seaweed , raspberries , candy canes , and void parasites don't have a totem.

These rocks have the same properties and chances of spawning rare drops (e.g. crystallized iron ) as naturally-spawning ore rocks on other islands ). Mineral totems have 6 slots, each holding 3 items, and a 20-second cooldown between spawning and harvesting. When placed next to a conveyor , they dispense minerals every 30 seconds instead of spawning rocks, but rare drops cannot be obtained this way.

It previously functioned as a faster iron totem with a higher chance to drop crystallized iron , but it now shares equal stats as iron totems. It is only obtainable through trading .  Prior to November 1, 2020 , the test totem model was invisible when held and disappeared if dropped, leaving an invisible hitbox on mobile.  Totem Upgrades [ ]  Most totems, except test totems and berry totems ( red berry , blueberry , and blackberry ) can be upgraded with coins and specific minerals. Players can access the upgrade menu via the \"Upgrade\" button in totem's storage UI, and its stats can be viewed on the left side of its upgrade menu. The totem's appearance changes every 20 levels and at the final level (level 53).  Breaking an upgraded totem refunds all resources spent on upgrades.  Upgrade Types [ ]  Utility [ ]  Nearby crop grow rate: This stat is exclusive to crop totems. It boosts the grow rate of all crops within an 8-block radius, including those of different types and crops that do not have a corresponding crop totem. The boost can be stacked with other totems with this stat. Block hit damage when near: This upgrade stat is exclusive to mineral totems. It boosts players' block hit damage within a 15-block radius, meaning the player can break any block (or tree ) with less hits. The boost can be stacked with other totems with this stat.  Efficiency [ ]  Action speed: This stat boosts the rate of action made by totem, i.e. spawning/breaking ore rocks and harvesting crops . The speed of dropping items on a conveyor IS affected by this upgrade. Action speed at night: This stat upgrade occurs on every 6th efficiency upgrade level. It is similar to the action speed upgrade but only applies at night.  Quality [ ]  Product yield: This stat increases the production yield of totems. Items picked up manually or deposited into a chest reflect the bonus yield. However, machines such as food processors and industrial ovens will only register the item as a single unit, regardless of the bonus. Product yield for each unique nearby totem type: This stat upgrade occurs on every 6th efficiency upgrade level and is exclusive to crop totems. It increases the production yield based on the number of different crop totem types within an 8-block radius. However, berry totems ( red berry , blueberry , and blackberry ) do not contribute to the yield bonus. For example, if a wheat totem has 5% of this stat and there is 1 potato totem, 1 carrot totem, and 2 tomato totems nearby, the wheat totem will gain +20% product yield (5% from each of the four unique totems, including itself).

Trivia [ ]  Crop totems require at least one planted crop to begin harvesting and replanting. Red berry , blueberry , blackberry , and test totems are the only totems that cannot be upgraded. Totems were remodeled on April 16, 2021 , but, until the May 8, 2021 update, their legacy model would appear instead. The remodeled totems used to have a 3x3 hitbox, but this was reverted to the original 1x1 on May 8, 2021. An animation-related lag issue with totems was fixed in the December 10, 2021 update. Pineapple totems initially failed to collect pineapples upon release, but the bug was fixed shortly after. Since the January 15, 2022 update, red berry, blueberry, and blackberry totems have been discontinued and are no longer purchasable from Arius in the Hub. On April 1, 2022 , icons were added to totems to differentiate between totem types. Red berry , blueberry , and blackberry totems can no longer be traded ."

    "content": "Trading is a mechanic introduced in the August 28, 2021 update with the idea of players having a more sufficient way of trading items.  Trading [ ]  In order to unlock the ability to trade, the player must have an average skill level of 30. This means needing a total skill level of 390 (combined in every category).  To trade, click the shake hands icon on the left and press \"F\" or tap near another player. Receiving trade requests does not require trade mode to be enabled. If the other player accepts, they will be prompted with the trading GUI. They can either choose to put 1, 5 or 10 items in their offer slots. If a player wanted to add a specific amount of items they can do so by clicking the three dots to add however many items they want. Once both players accept the trade, the items they offered will be transferred into each players inventory and they will own the traded items.  Disabling [ ]  Clicking the shake hands icon after clicking it once disables trading. This only disables the player's ability to send trade requests to other players. The player can always re-enable trading.  Untradable items [ ]  Trade Disabled History [ ]  From December 29, 2021 to January 6, 2022, trading was disabled due to a duplication exploit . It was temporarily re-enabled on January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2022 before being disabled again.  On October 5, 2022 , trading was temporarily disabled for a few hours due to a supposed duplication exploit.  From May 6, 2023 to May 8, 2023, trading was temporarily disabled due to another duplication exploit. No items were wiped.  Trivia [ ]  Prior to the April 9, 2022 update, inserting a specific number of an item would be blocked by the item's tool tip. This has now been fixed. When trading was disabled, storage systems such as chests were disabled as well."

April 17, 2023 Fixed a bug causing treasure chests not from Pirate Island or the Hub when broken to turn into a regular treasure chest.  Trivia [ ]  From October 18, 2021 to October 25, 2021, the green dot representing the player on the treasure map was set at an offset, meaning that it had incorrectly shown the player's location. However, the location of the buried treasure chest marked by the red 'X' was still accurate in accordance to the surrounding terrain. Leaving and rejoining the game while having an unclaimed reward from a treasure chest will display it as an uncommon item, regardless of rarity. Treasure chests that have been opened but the rewards have not been claimed will close when the player goes away. However, the item will still be there spinning, so items like sharks will be seen outside of the chest, still spinning. Prior to April 17, 2023 , breaking treasure chests from islands other than Pirate Island and the Hub would turn it into a regular treasure chest."

    "content": "Treasure Map Item Hub Maple Isles Spirit Island Pirate Island Slime Island Buffalkor Island Wizard Island Desert Island Old Hub Patrick Star Halloween Buy cost 120 doubloons Description A map to find hidden treasure, use a shovel to dig it up! A treasure map is an item is used to locate a treasure chest . It cannot be dropped, traded , or put in vending machines and chests .  Obtaining [ ]  Interacting [ ]  If the player interacts with Davey when he comes to the player's island without having a treasure map in their inventory , the player may accept a free treasure map from him.  Purchasing [ ]  Treasure maps can be purchased from Davey for 120 doubloons each on Pirate Island if the player does not have a treasure map in their inventory.  Usage [ ]  Locating [ ]  Holding a treasure map will reveal a map of the Hub , Pirate Island , Spirit Island , Maple Isles , Slime Island , Buffalkor Island , Wizard Island , or Desert Island with a red 'X' in a randomized location indicating a hidden treasure chest . Once the player has dug up the treasure chest, the map will disappear from the player's inventory.  Each treasure map only locates one treasure chest and only one treasure map can be used per day. Treasure maps may be discarded in trash cans in order to obtain a new one from Davey.  History [ ]  July 17, 2021 Added treasure maps. October 18, 2021 Changed the bird's-eye view to match the Halloween-themed Hub . October 25, 2021 Fixed the accuracy of the player on the treasure map UI. November 13, 2021 Fixed treasure map issues. December 10, 2021 Fixed the bug preventing players from having and using multiple treasure maps from their inventory . Changed the bird's-eye view to match the current Hub. April 12, 2022 Changed the bird's-eye view to match the current Hub. April 16, 2022 Treasure maps can now show treasure chests on Slime Island , Maple Isles , Spirit Island , Pirate Island , Buffalkor Island , Wizard Island , and Desert Island . April 22, 2022 Fixed a bug that prevented treasure maps obtained before April 16, 2022 to correctly locate a buried treasure chest . April 29, 2022 Corrected the horizontal compression of the bird's-eye view of the Maple Isles. July 9, 2022 Changed the bird's-eye view of Slime Island. Treasure maps are now labeled with the island name the treasure is on. Treasure maps can now be discarded in trash cans . July 16, 2022 Fixed a bug that caused treasure maps to not be attainable after discarding them in trash cans. Changed the bird's-eye view of the Hub.  Trivia [ ]  Before the Halloween 2021 event, the bird's-eye view resembled the Hub during the Patrick Star event despite the event having already ended. There was a bug where if the player has two or more treasure maps in their inventory at once, only one of the treasure maps is usable and all other treasure maps that existed during the time will permanently be unusable. This was fixed in the December 10, 2021 update. From October 18, 2021 to October 25, 2021, the green dot representing the player was set at an offset, meaning that it had incorrectly shown the player's location. However, the location of the buried treasure chest marked by the red 'X' was still accurate in accordance to the surrounding terrain. Prior to April 29, 2022 , the red 'X' on the Maple Isles treasure map was off-scale as the map of the isles itself was horizontally compressed."

    "content": "Turkey Behavior Passive Location Maple Isles (5 turkeys) Player's Island (3 turkeys) A turkey is a medium passive mob found on the Maple Isles and can be spawned on the player's island using a turkey spawn egg . It is the only way to harvest raspberries from raspberry bushes. Players can only have 3 turkeys on their island at a time. One turkey can harvest up to 3 - 4 berries before dropping them off at a berry basket or industrial berry basket or being spooked.  It is the fifth animal passive mob or the first and only medium animal passive mob in Islands .  Uses [ ]  Turkeys will go to a red berry bush, blueberry bush, blackberry bush, and raspberry bush and harvest it if they are not hungry. If the turkey's hunger is 25% or less, it will consume it and you will not receive the berry. If a player has a berry basket or an industrial berry basket , it will proceed to put the berries in the basket.  Spooking [ ]  Player's island [ ]  Spooking turkeys on the player's island will give the player any berries that have not been put inside of a berry basket or industrial berry basket .  Maple Isles [ ]  Spooking turkeys on Maple Isles will reward the player with 1 - 2 red berries or raspberries . They also reward no token when Fhanhorn is added.  Behavior [ ]  Like all animals, turkeys can breed. They can be lured and fed with any berry, but will have berry pie , honey toast , bread , and tomato soup as their favorite food. It takes 5 in-game days (1 hour and 40 minutes) for a baby turkey to grow into an adult. If they fall into the void, they will respawn at the player's spawn point.  Like other animals , if no troughs are in its vicinity, it will eat from a grass block , but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.  Mounting [ ]  After reaching level 8 Animal Care , turkeys can be mounted by the player through the inspection menu, located next to the \"Sell Animal\" button.  A turkey can be rode on any island in the player's server. To get off, press the dismount button on the right of the screen. Players can still place/use blocks and tools while mounting. Mounting a turkey does not grant any speed boost or jump boost.  Dismounting a turkey while outside of the player's island will teleport the turkey to the player's island spawn point.  History [ ]  November 27, 2021 Added turkeys. December 10, 2021 Fixed a bug that prevented turkeys from dropping berries into berry baskets and industrial berry baskets .  Trivia [ ]  Turkeys are the first spawn egg that cannot be purchased from Taliyah , with the second being vultures . Turkeys attempt to flee from players in the Maple Isles or sometimes in the player's island . Like all other animals, turkeys may eat from a grass block instead of from troughs, but doing so will not replenish their hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP. The eating sound of turkeys is reduced when eating grass blocks. This was likely can be done if no trough are nearby. A turkey being spooked by the player while asleep. When a player spooks a turkey while asleep, it will still be spooked. However, the turkey will continue sleeping after being spooked by the player. Turkeys are able to move with sleeping animation, but this can be fixed by mounting and dismounting them. Turkeys share many things with other animals . Turkeys share the same eating sound as cows , sheep , pigs , yaks , and horses . Unlike cows, sheep, pigs, yaks, and horses, turkeys only have manually feed sound. Turkeys have the same type of favorite foods as cows or award the same amount of XP as cows and yaks. Turkeys have the same eye model as ducks , yaks, horses, and the old model of cows. Turkeys walk slightly faster on player islands than on the Maple Isles. Turkeys doesn't have some animations, including idle, petted, awake, and looking animations. Turkeys doesn't reward Farming XP or extra berry seeds when harvesting berry bushes . The hitbox of players is slightly increased when mounting a turkey. Turkeys, horses, and vultures are the only three animals that doesn't have a looking or petted animation. Like mounting a horse or vulture, the turkey able to turn around while camera lock or first-person view then jumping and mounting. Turkeys doesn't harvest berry bushes when mounted. Turkeys are the first and only medium animal passive mob in Islands . As such, turkeys are the first and only animal that doesn't count as the player's large animal limit or small animal limit. Unlike most animals, turkeys doesn't have any animation when mounted. Turkeys, cows, and yaks have the same number of favorite foods. Turkeys award the lowest amount of Animal Care XP, tied with cows and yaks. When a player spooks a turkey, it doesn't reward Animal Care XP nor Fhanhorn tokens . Unlike most animals with an error message, if a player attempts to spawn more than 3 turkeys due to medium animal, nothing happens."

Instead of giving you a Workbench Tier 1 , it now gives you a Workbench , a type of workbench with only 2 recipes, and an extra mini-island with a tree and an iron node.  In the March 5, 2021 update, the Tutorial was changed and revamped. The whole starter island was revamped, there was a smaller island and a larger \"main\" island. On the main island, the player could cut down their first tree and start to farm. Before the Revamp , The plow was on the 1st island (out of 3), but after, it was on the 2nd \"Main\" Island (out of 2).  The first step the player was required to do was to mine grass blocks to get to the main island.  The Tutorial (March 5th, 2021) [ ]  Welcome to your island!  In Islands you can build , trade , explore , and more. Your island is one of many in the Islands universe  Let's start by learning how to use your axe. Select it by clicking on the hotbar.  (Select Wooden Axe)  Nearly everything on your island is destructible. Go destroy a tree to gather wood. Click-and-hold on the tree.  (Chop down a Tree)  Now let's craft a pickaxe. Open your Starter Workbench and craft the Wooden Pickaxe.  (Craft a Wooden Pickaxe)  Let's create a bridge to your portal. Gather a few blocks of grass using the pickaxe.  (Mine Grass)  Create a bridge by placing the grass blocks.  (Place Grass)  There is lots to explore! When you're ready, enter the Magic Portal.  (Go through the portal)  You have discovered the Hub. This is where you gather materials, trade with merchants, and explore.  The Hub village has easy access to Iron , Coal, and Stone. Try Gathering some Iron near the mining area.  (Mine Iron Ore)  When you're ready to go back to your island, click the Home button on the right side of your screen.  (Ends Tutorial)"

Economy level 25 is needed to be able to buy from vending machines and Economy level 35 to sell using vending machines. To craft the block itself and edit it, economy level 45 is required for tier one, for tier two you need Economy level 70. Only players with build permission can access the editing interface.  A 10% and 7% tax is applied to transactions in vending machines and tier 2 vending machines respectively.  A vending machine will say \"Out of Money\" when the machine doesn't have enough money added to cover the cost of buying an item from a player trying to sell. To fix this, the machine's owner would need to add more money.  A vending machine will say \"Items Full\" when the machine doesn't have any more capacity to hold additional items (tier 1 - 300; tier 2 - 1000). To fix this, the machine's owner would need to remove some or all of the items already inside the machine.  A vending machine will say \"Offline\" if the machine is empty or if the island owner does not wish for the items inside to be sold. Turning on \"BUY ITEM,\" or \"SELL ITEM,\" will turn the machine back online.  Editing interface [ ]  Mode Buttons Changes whether or not the item displayed can be bought (\"SELL ITEM\") or sold (\"BUY ITEM\"). (Sell is the player selling items, giving items for a price; buy is the player buying an item, and taking away items for a price)  Price Management Used to adjust the price for the item to be bought or sold by simply inputting a number and pressing Enter button to confirm the price. The price can be up to 1 billion (1,000,000,000) coins.  Tax Index Shows how many coins the owner pays/gains from buying/selling items after tax.  Restock Button Once an item has been placed inside the vending machine, the restock option will instantly fill the vending machine with the same item from the player's inventory, until it reaches its limit, or the player has no more of the specified item in their inventory.  Withdraw Button Allows the player to withdraw coins inside the vending machine. A player can select to withdraw a specific amount of coins from its balance, or to withdraw all coins. The Coin Balance allows the player to see how much money the Vending Machine currently holds.  Deposit Buttons Allows the player to deposit coins in the vending machine, in a custom quantity up to a limit of 5 billion coins (5,000,000,000) per machine. Depositing coins is made easier by the use of letter shortcuts including, k, M, B. For example, depositing 100,000 coins can be shortened to \"100k\", 100,000,000 to \"100M\" and 1,000,000,000 to \"1B\".  Coins Balance Shows how many coins are currently stored inside the Vending Machine.  Item Slot Inputs items to be bought or sold by selecting the item from the inventory. Clicking the occupied slot will take all but 1 item from the Vending Machine. The regular Vending Machine slot can hold up to 300 items. The Tier Vending Machine 2 slot can hold up to 1,000 items.  Editing Guide [ ]  In order to set up a vending machine correctly, it is advised to take these steps:  Set the shop to its mode. Set the cost of the desired item(s) to be bought or sold. (Note: If the following step is done before this step, other players will be able to buy/sell the item(s) before the correct price is set up). Place the desired item(s) to be bought or sold.  Bugs [ ]  There is a bug when there is an island that has been up for a long time that makes it so Vending Machines are blank and break the client if attempted to open. To fix this, you should restart your island or break and replace the Vending Machines.  History [ ]  May 31, 2020 Added vending machines. Breaking a vending machine now gives the player its contents.

It has 50,000 health and can be summoned in the Void Isles for at least 300 Void Serpent tokens . It has no summon cooldown.  Description [ ]  The Void Serpent can be summoned in its arena in the Void Isles for at least 300 Void Serpent tokens .  Like other bosses , if there are no players in the arena, if the player is idle for too long, or if the battle takes more than 10 minutes, the Void Serpent will despawn and the player will have to respawn it with at least 300 more Void Serpent tokens.  Attacks [ ]  Burrow [ ]  The Void Serpent will burrow itself, creating a burrow hole and pink square trail when targeting a player in the arena. Once its target is near it, it will pop out, dealing 20 damage and dealing extremely high knockback.  Dive [ ]  The Void Serpent will dive in and out of the ground and create a burrow hole to reach areas of the arena. Any player that goes near it while it is diving will be dealt 80 damage and moderate knockback.  Hound Summon [ ]  Burrow holes in the arena will summon a void hound every 1 - 5 seconds. The total number of void hounds the number summoned varies in proportion to the number of players currently fighting the serpent.  Unlike the Grand High Witch , Bhaa , the Infernal Dragon , Percival the Pumpkin King , the Slime Queen , and Zombie Cletus , it always summon void hounds.  Roar [ ]  The Void Serpent will roar, summoning 2 -\u00a0? void hounds and puffing out void smoke that will damage players in contact with it 7 HP every second. The smoke will dissipate after 45 seconds. The number of void hounds summoned varies in proportion to the number of players currently fighting the serpent.  Body Slam [ ]  The Void Serpent will smash its body on the ground, dealing 60 HP of damage and extremely high knockback to players if hit.  Bite [ ]  The Void Serpent will lower its head and bite players that are in front of it. Players that are bitten will be dealt 40 HP.  Drops [ ]  The Void Serpent rewards 2250 (9000 with the 4x daily bonus or 225 when maxed out) Combat XP and 2250 (9000 with the 4x daily bonus or 225 when maxed out) Light Melee , Heavy Melee , Magic , or Archery XP depending on the weapon the player used to defeat it.  With a Jam Sandwich , the Void Serpent rewards 2587 (10350 with the 4x daily bonus or 258 when maxed out) Combat XP and 2587 (10350 with the 4x daily bonus or 258 when maxed out) Light Melee , Heavy Melee , Magic , or Archery XP depending on the weapon the player used to defeat it.  Prior to October 22, 2022 , only a certain number of players will receive drops if too many players are simultaneously fighting it. However, all players will still receive Combat XP.  Image Name Drop chance Void Serpent Token * 100 - 200 Amethyst Crystal * 4 - 8 Serpent Egg 100% Serpent's Scale 5% Serpent's Fang 5% Jukebox Disks Red Jukebox Disk 0.35% Yellow Jukebox Disk 0.35% Blue Jukebox Disk 0.35% Green Jukebox Disk 0.01% Purple Jukebox Disk 0.01% Orange Jukebox Disk 0.01%  * The drop amount is not affected by the captain's rapier , the dragon roll , or the blueberry cookie .  Damage reduction [ ]  The Void Serpent reduces the amount of damage dealt to it by 10% to 80% depending on the number of players (compounds) in the arena.  Number of players Damage reduction 1 0% 2 10% 3 25% 4 35% 5 45% 6 55% 7 65% 8 75% 9+ 80%  History [ ]  August 13, 2022 Added the Void Serpent. Fixed a bug that caused the Void Serpent to get stuck inside of the ground. August 15, 2022 Increased Void Serpent health from 30,000 to 50,000. Decreased the drop rates of serpent's fangs and serpent's scales from 10% to 5%. August 20, 2022 The Void Serpent can now drop serpent eggs upon defeat. The Void Serpent's health now increases in proportion to the amount of players currently fighting it. Changed the Void Serpent's damage reduction. May 16, 2023 Decreased knockbacks of the Void Serpent's attacks. Decreased the amount of void hounds spawned by the Void Serpent. Increased the movement speed of underground state of the Void Serpent.  Trivia [ ]  The Void Serpent is the first and only boss whose summon message says which player spawned the boss. The Void Serpent may be inspired by Apophis/Apep, the Egyptian god of darkness. The Void Serpent's summon message is in the same format as Terraria's boss summon messages. This boss is most likely to be a reference to The Devourer of Gods from Calamity Mod, as both bosses are serpentine, can summon a mob to aid them in battle and have a head charge attack as their strongest attack. Many attacks seem to be based off of the Volcanic Sandworm boss from Soul Knight . The Void Serpent, Percival the Pumpkin King , the Infernal Dragon , the Slime Queen , and Draven are the only bosses that don't have a summon cooldown. They are also the only bosses that require tokens to be summoned. This boss has the most HP of any boss. This is one of the only bosses that drops its own token upon defeat, along with Zombie Cletus . Due to the constant spawns of void hounds , this boss is one of the hardest bosses added in Islands as the hounds do damage to players while the void serpent is vulnerable to attacks by players due to it being unbalanced. Like Zombie Cletus , the Void Serpent can be summoned over and over."

    "content": "Vulture Behavior Passive Effect Speed (Currently doesn't indicate when mounted) Location Player's Island A vulture is a medium passive mob added in the March 17, 2023 update. It can be spawned from a vulture spawn egg and can be mounted when fully grown.  It is the ninth and final animal passive mob in Islands .  Spawning [ ]  Vultures can be spawned through a vulture spawn egg , which can be bought from Rick . Higher-tier eggs can be obtained by breeding two vultures.  Behavior [ ]  Dropping feathers [ ]  Vultures will drop feathers shortly after being fed with their favorite foods or carp . If there is a nest nearby it might drop a feather onto it, but it's not guaranteed. Feathers on a grass block will not despawn.  Sleeping [ ]  When it becomes night in-game, vultures will go to sleep. While they can sleep anywhere and sometimes will, they prefer to sleep on a nest.  Following [ ]  Vultures will follow players that are holding carp .  Breeding [ ]  After two vultures have been given a potion of fertility each, they will breed, creating a vulture spawn egg . The egg will be of a tier between 1 and 3.  Prior to May 1, 2023 , vultures currently cannot be bred.  Inspecting [ ]  Vultures can be inspected to show a menu that allows the player to see information about the vulture, listed below:  Mount Sell value (Sell value depends on the vulture's happiness and tier) Information Food level Favorite foods Happiness level Traits (fertility, productivity, and friendliness) Personality  Feeding [ ]  Vultures can be fed approximately every 30-60 seconds (confirmation needed). Vultures can be lured with carp , but they also have their own favorite foods . They can have 3 favorite foods. The foods a vulture can have as its favorite foods are berry pies , sushi rolls , and starfruit cakes .  Feeding a vulture will increase its food and friendliness level. The food level is necessary to keep above 20% or the vulture will start losing happiness.  A wooden trough , metal trough , or automated trough can be used to feed vultures.  Like other animals , if no troughs are in its vicinity, it will eat from a grass block , but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.  Petting [ ]  A vulture can be pet every 5 minutes which increases its happiness level. The action yields 5 Animal Care XP (18 with the 4x daily bonus).  Mounting [ ]  Vultures can be mounted via the button in the inspect menu if the player is level 8 or higher in Animal Care. A mounted vulture can be ridden anywhere within the server. If the vulture is dismounted outside the player's island or falls into the void, the vulture will respawn on the island spawn point. Mounting a vulture will grant a 25% or 1.25x speed boost and does not fly. When the player taking any damage while mounting a vulture, it will no longer automatically be dismounted.  Like mounting a horse and unlike mounting a duck or yak , the status effect of vulture is doesn't indicate when mounted.  Personality [ ]  Vultures are assigned a personality upon spawning. All personalities have the same probability, except for resourceful which is more uncommon.  Personality Description Effects Trivia Lazy \"Your vulture is lazy. They sleep for a long time, but gain a bit of happiness while sleeping.\" Vulture will sleep during the afternoon and evening, but will still gain happiness while sleeping. Level-headed \"Your vulture is level-headed. They will not gain or lose happiness quickly.\" Self-Explanatory Loyal \"Your vulture is loyal. They are extra happy around players and animals but can become very lonely when left alone.\" Vultures will gain happiness faster if players and/ or animals are within an unknown number blocks, but will lose happiness fast if they are further than that threshold. Friendly \"Your vulture is friendly. They will bring you extra gifts.\" Unknown Resourceful \"Woah! Your vulture is resourceful. They will produce items faster than other animals.\" Vultures will make products faster than normal. This is the rarest personality.  History [ ]  March 17, 2023 Added vultures. Introduced where vultures are now able to eat grass blocks if no troughs are nearby. Introduced a bug where vultures cannot be bred with potions of fertility . March 31, 2023 Vultures can now be mounted. Introduced where the status effect icon doesn't indicate when mounting a vulture. Vultures can now drop feathers onto nests and industrial nests instead of around them. May 1, 2023 Vultures can now be bred with potions of fertility to obtain higher tier eggs. May 12, 2023 Fixed a bug where players couldn't breed vultures.  Trivia [ ]  Prior to March 31, 2023 , vultures cannot be mounted. Prior to May 1, 2023 , vultures cannot be bred with potions of fertility . Unlike mounting a duck or yak , the vulture is the second animal mount that doesn't indicate a status effect icon when mounted due to its permanently boost, with the first being horse . Vultures, turkeys , and horses are the only three animals that doesn't have a looking or petted animation. Like mounting a turkey or horse, the vulture able to turn around while camera lock or first-person view then jumping and mounting. Unlike turkeys, vultures count as small animal instead of medium animal. The hitbox of players is slightly increased when mounting a vulture."

To fill a water jug , interact with the water catcher and hold a water jug then click/tap the fill button. This can be used to transport the water to another water catcher or water barrel .  Filling sprinklers [ ]  Placing a water catcher within a 10 block radius of a basic sprinkler will automatically fill it, which will then water any farmland within a 1 block radius.  History [ ]  June 15, 2020 Added water catchers.  Trivia [ ]  Despite the water catcher having a funnel for collecting rainfall and the fact that Islands does have rain , the water catcher will catch water any time, any weather, and anywhere (even indoors). When the Water Catcher was first released, there was a bug that allowed the player to have a set amount of water and you could keep on replacing it to get more. This has since then been patched in the following bug fix update. Watering cans used to be fillable in a water catcher, but this was changed in the November 1, 2020 update, which made them have an infinite amount of water."

    "content": "Weapons are items that are used to attack and defeat mobs or other players if PVP is enabled. There are four different categories of weapons: Light Melee , Heavy Melee , Archery , and Magic . Defeating hostile mobs will award the player with Combat XP and XP for the combat skill of the weapon currently held. If no weapon is held, no weapon class XP will be awarded. The damage for each weapon increases for each level of the corresponding weapon skill that the players have.  When multiple players simultaneously attack a hostile mob, only the damage dealt by a randomly selected player will register.  Weapons [ ]  Melee weapons are weapons specialized for close-combat attacks. They have a chance to do critical hits which increases damage by 50% of the base damage.  Heavy Melee weapons [ ]  Heavy Melee weapons generally deal more damage than Light Melee weapons .  Light Melee weapons [ ]  Light Melee weapons generally deal less damage than Heavy Melee weapons. Most of these weapons have the same attack speed as Heavy Melee weapons, but the rageblade has the fastest attack speed.  Shields [ ]  Shields are weapons that can damage and reduce damage from mobs. They can also push mobs in a straight line.  Ranged weapons [ ]  Ranged weapons are not as effective in close combat, but more so at attacking mobs from a distance.  Archery [ ]  Bows deal different amounts of damage depending on the duration that the bow has been drawn and the player's Archery level. Full charges will deal full damage, while short charges deal less. Bows require arrows to fire, using 1 arrow per released charge.  Magic [ ]  Magic weapons do not need ammunition of any sort. Some magic weapons, such as the Slime Queen's scepter , may heal the player when an enemy is hit.  Critical hits [ ]  Melee weapons have a chance of dealing a critical hit (referred to as \"star strikes\" by Ivon ). Critical hits deal 1.5x of the weapon's base damage. All ranged weapons except for the lightning scepter do not possess the ability to land critical hits.  Since the January 22, 2021 update, critical hits from melee weapons will deal a fixed amount of damage instead of a ranged amount.  Event weapons [ ]  Event weapons are limited items that can no longer be obtained after their respective events have ended. They can still be obtained through trading with other players.

The direction in which the attack is cast does not change for the duration of the attack. It is an unusual attack, as it does small amounts of damage, but attacks multiple times rather swiftly.  Pulse Attack [ ]  The pulse attack is a long-ranged attack meant to attack players using a Magic weapon. It is similar to the current Lighting Scepter\u2019s attack, a single lightning bolt is cast in a straight line at the player's current position. It deals 5 damage per hit. The direction in which the attack is cast does not change for the duration of the attack. It is an unusual attack, as it does small amounts of damage, but attacks multiple times rather swiftly.  Explosion Attack [ ]  The explosion attack is faster than any Magic weapon other than the static scepter. It has a similar projectile to the tidal spellbook and the same sound effect as the spellbook . This spell can be detonated prematurely by hitting the projectile with one cast by a spellbook, tidal spellbook, or spirit spellbook . The attack deals 40 HP.

The bobber used to be able to be dragged around, making fishing easier. This has since been changed. If a player casts the rod and jump off from their island, it will ragdoll the player when the player is teleported. The bobber can allow the player to hang from a ledge, if positioned above the blocks a player wants to hang from.

Upgrading the crafting station will replace the workbench tier 3 with a workbench tier 4.  History [ ]  April 10, 2020 Added workbench tier 3s. September 18, 2020 Changed the recipe of workbench tier 3s from 20 steel rods , 50 stone bricks , and 20 maple wood to 450 iron , 50 stone bricks , and 20 maple wood . July 23, 2021 Changed the recipe of workbench tier 3s from 450 iron , 50 stone bricks , and 20 maple wood to 400 iron , 50 stone , and 20 maple wood .  Trivia [ ]  Before the May 10, 2020 update, conveyors were crafted in this crafting station instead of in anvils . On September 18, 2020 , new players could not craft the workbench tier 3 because its recipe required steel rods , an item that was not possible to craft with the recipes in the workbench tier 2 due to the introduction of the steel mill . This was fixed the following day."

Trivia [ ]  Meshes will appear gray in the bird's-eye view of islands . The Maple Isles is incorrectly referred to as \"Maple Island\". There are only two permanent islands which the world map guide does not show: the Diamond Mines , which has its information merged with the Buffalkor Island page; and the Void Isles , which the world map guide has no information on. The Underworld page in the world map guide does not include a bird's-eye view of the island; instead, the text \"UNKNOWN LOCATION\" appears instead. This is because the bird's-eye view of each island are directly recycled from the ones that appear on treasure maps , which does not include a view of the Underworld."

    "content": "Yak Behavior Passive Effect Speed (+25% when mounted) Location Player's Island A yak is a large passive mob that was added in the March 25, 2022 update and a source of yak milk . Players can ride it to receive a 25% speed boost.  It is the seventh animal passive mob in Islands .  Spawning [ ]  The number of yaks that can exist on the player's island varies depending on their level in Animal Care .  Yak spawn egg [ ]  Yaks can be spawned with yak spawn eggs . Yak spawn eggs are obtained by breeding yaks or purchasing them from Taliyah .  Behavior [ ]  A yak can be lured with radishes and can sleep on hay beds .  Milking [ ]  A yak can be milked with a bucket or automatically with an industrial milker to create a yak milk bucket . Yaks can be milked after fully feeding them.  Breeding [ ]  After two yaks have been given a potion of fertility each, they will breed, creating a yak spawn egg . The egg will be of a tier between 1 and 3.  Sleeping [ ]  When it becomes night in-game, yaks will go to sleep. While they can sleep anywhere and sometimes will, they prefer to sleep on a hay bed.  Inspecting [ ]  Yaks can be inspected to show a menu that allows the player to see information about the yak, listed below:  Mount Sell value Information Food level Favorite foods Happiness level Traits (fertility, productivity, and friendliness) Personality  Feeding [ ]  Yaks can be fed approximately every 90 - 100 seconds. Yaks eat radishes , but will also each have its own favorite foods. The foods a yak can have as its favorite food are bread , sushi rolls , tomato soup , and avocado toast .  Feeding a yak will increase its food and friendliness level. The food level is necessary to keep above 20% or the yak will start losing happiness. The milking cooldown can also be skipped if a yak is fully fed.  A wooden trough , metal trough , or automated trough can be used to feed yaks.  Like other animals , if no troughs are in its vicinity, it will eat from a grass block , but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.  Petting [ ]  A yak can be petted every 5 minutes, which increases its happiness level. The action yields 5 Animal Care XP (18 XP with the 4x daily bonus).  Mounting [ ]  Yaks can be mounted via the button in the inspect menu if the player is level 8 or higher in Animal Care. A mounted yak can be ridden anywhere within the server. If the yak is dismounted outside the player's island or falls into the void, the yak will respawn on the island spawn point. Mounting a yak will grant a 25% speed boost that stacks with other items that grant bonus movement speed. When the player taking any damage while mounting a yak, it will no longer automatically be dismounted.  Personality [ ]  Yaks are assigned a personality upon spawning. All personalities have the same possibility, except for resourceful which is more uncommon.  Personality Description Effects Trivia Lazy \"Your yak is lazy. They sleep for a long time, but gain a bit of happiness while sleeping.\" Yak will sleep during the afternoon and evening, but will still gain happiness while sleeping. Level-headed \"Your yak is level-headed. They will not gain or lose happiness quickly.\" Self-Explanatory Loyal \"Your yak is loyal. They are extra happy around players and animals but can become very lonely when left alone.\" Yak will gain happiness faster if players and/or animals are within an unknown number blocks, but will lose happiness fast if they are further than that threshold. Friendly \"Your yak is friendly. They will bring you extra gifts.\" Unknown Resourceful \"Woah! Your yak is resourceful. They will produce items faster than other animals.\" Yak will make products (yak milk) faster than normal. This is the rarest personality.  History [ ]  March 25, 2022 Added yaks. Introduced where yaks are now able to eat grass blocks . Changed the \"Info\" section of the yak's inspection UI to reference itself instead of cows . April 9, 2022 Fixed a bug that prevented yaks from being milked with a bucket . Fixed a bug that prevented yaks from eating from wooden troughs , metal troughs , or automated troughs .  Trivia [ ]  Yaks can move with the sleeping animation, but this can be fixed by mounting and dismounting. Like all other animals, yaks may eat from a grass block instead of from troughs, but doing so will not replenish their hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP. This can be done if no troughs are nearby. The eating sound of yaks is reduced when eating grass blocks. Although yaks can jump over 3-height blocks, yaks cannot jump over half-height blocks such as slabs . If a player mounts another animal while being mounted on a yak, they will continue to have the speed boost even when unmounted. The yak's inspection UI incorrectly states that it can be fed wheat instead of radishes . The \"Info\" section in the yak's inspection UI was a direct copy of the cows before it was changed half an hour after the update was released. Before April 9, 2022 , yaks could only be milked using an industrial milker and could not eat from troughs. Yaks are the third-tallest animal model, only behind the old model of cows and horses . Yaks share many things with other animals . Yaks share the same eating sound as cows, sheep , pigs , turkeys , and horses. Yaks have the same eye model as turkeys, ducks , horses, and the old model of cows. Yaks have the same animations as cows, sheep, and pigs. Yaks have the same horn model as cows. Yaks do not have a sound when mooing, awake, or being petted. Like ducks and horses, there was a bug where the extra boosts granted when mounting a yak will wear off when joining other servers. This was fixed in the July 9, 2022 update. The hitbox of players is slightly increased when mounting a yak. Yaks are the second animal that granted a speed boost when mounted, with the other being ducks and horses. Yaks, cows, and turkeys have the same amount of Animal Care XP and number of favorite foods ."
