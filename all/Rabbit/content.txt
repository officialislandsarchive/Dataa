Rabbit White Brown Pink Behavior Passive Location Player's Island A rabbit is a passive mob that has a chance of spawning on a player's island during or after a rain shower in the winter .

Spawning [ ]

Rabbits, like frogs , naturally spawn on the player's island on or after rainy days in the winter . Rabbits come in three colors, which are white, brown and pink; brown being the most common and pink being the rarest. A player can catch a rabbit using a net . When caught, the player will receive a caged rabbit in their inventory that can be released again. Only a maximum of three rabbits can be released on an island that will stay permanently, unlike naturally-spawned rabbits which disappear after a while.

Behavior [ ]

Rabbits, like all other passive mobs, are attracted to grass blocks . They run away from the player in order to not get caught. They can respawn back after falling off in the void.
