New save [ ]

Players can create a new save by selecting an empty slot, this will open the "Save Settings" menu, which allows a player to select between a Solo slot or a Co-op slot, after selecting one the player will be sent to a new server on a starter island. It functions as though using a different account, except that all of a player's gamepasses apply to all saves.

Co-op saves [ ]

Co-op slots can have up to 7 "owners" which can all load into the island by themselves or join the existing one (If a member of that island is on the co-op save slot). To invite somebody to a co-op island open the save slots menu and select "invite", a player's invites can be found in this menu too.
