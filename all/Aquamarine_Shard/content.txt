Obtaining [ ]

Natural generation [ ]

Aquamarine rocks naturally spawn at the bottom of the Hub Lake and Slime Reef . Mining an aquamarine rock grants the player 1 - 2 aquamarine shards and 9 Mining XP (39 with the 4x daily bonus) per stage, resulting in a total of 2 - 4 aquamarine shards and 18 Mining XP (78 with the 4x daily bonus) per full rock. The rock has a 0.5% chance to yield a crystallized aquamarine when it is fully broken.

Totems [ ]

An aquamarine totem will spawn aquamarine rocks in a 5 block radius. After the totem has spawned 6 aquamarine rocks or has run out of space, the totem will begin to mine the rocks and hold rewards equivalent to a half of an ore rock, which can be collected by interacting with the totem.

An aquamarine totem placed next to a conveyor belt will drop aquamarine shards onto the conveyor belt.

Fishing [ ]

Fishing with a wooden or iron fishing rod has a chance to reward 5 aquamarine shards as a treasure item, having a rarity of 'uncommon.'
