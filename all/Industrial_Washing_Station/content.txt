Usage [ ]

Auto-washing crops [ ]

Industrial washing stations can be used to automatically wash oily crops into their respective clean crop variant. Oily crops and fuel can be inputted through the conveyor belt opening at the front. It has six slots able to hold one item each in its user interface—three for oily crops and three for fuel. When powered with coal or petrified petroleum , the industrial washing station will activate for approximately 20 seconds. During this time, it will begin washing any oily crops inside, taking 1.5 seconds per crop.

Once done, the washed crops will be outputted through the conveyor belt at the other side of the machine.
