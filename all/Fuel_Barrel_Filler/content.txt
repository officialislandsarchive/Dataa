Usage [ ]

Transforming [ ]

Liquid oil or petroleum can be inputted through the pipe opening at the front. It has 6 slots that can hold one fuel per slot and takes 2 minutes 30 seconds or 150 seconds to convert six oil / petroleum fuel into one oil / petroleum barrel , compared to the Fuel Barrel Extractor, which only takes 4-5 seconds to do the reverse. Like the Petroleum Petrifier , the Oil Refinery , and the Fuel Barrel Extractor , it does not require any fuel source to be powered and the barrels will be outputted through the conveyor belt at the back once the process is complete.

Presumably, the machine runs on part of the petroleum that it is fed. However, the Oil Barrel can be then extracted at a Fuel Barrel Extractor (which also takes no fuel) into 6 Fuel again, which contradicts this assumption.

Input Output 6 Oil Fuel ➡ 1 Oil Barrel 6 Petroleum Fuel ➡ 1 Petroleum Barrel
