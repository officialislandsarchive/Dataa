It takes 6 minutes for a coconut to grow and 18 minutes for all three coconuts to grow.

Coconuts were also obtainable by harvesting them from naturally generated palm trees on Skull Island during the Godzilla vs. Kong event, and when harvested, there was a 4% chance of getting a palm tree sapling.

Trivia [ ]

This is one of the six crops that cannot be used to craft a food item, the others being pumpkins , watermelons , radishes , blackberries , and plums . Upon the release of the Godzilla vs. Kong event, players were able to cut down the palm trees on Skull Island , making it impossible to complete the first quest. It was fixed shortly after discovery, and the trees can no longer be chopped in the event area. At the same time, harvesting coconuts on player islands would not reward any XP. This was later found out and was quickly fixed by the developers. If a palm tree is chopped down while having coconuts on it, it will only drop the sapling and not any of the coconuts.
