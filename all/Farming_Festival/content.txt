Trivia [ ]

There was a glitch upon first release where harvesting any crop regardless of its crop value gives only 1 crop . This was shortly fixed. Fireworks were set off around the portal to Farming Festival Island in the Hub from 02:10 pm PST to 02:20 pm PST on July 30, 2021 . The Farming Festival was readded on September 25, 2021 due an issue causing prizes to be wiped from the inventory of some players.
