Usage [ ]

A water storage block has to be placed within a 9x9x9 block radius, meaning it can also be placed above or below the sprinkler. Each sprinkler covers a 3x3 area or one block in every direction of farmland around it. If there is no available water storage block nearby, an icon will appear above the sprinkler to indicate this.

Crops [ ]
