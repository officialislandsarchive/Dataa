Spawning [ ]

Rock mimics spawn on Buffalkor Island and in the Diamond Mines disguised as a coal , iron , or gold rock .

Behavior [ ]

Rock mimics will imitate coal rocks , iron rocks , or gold rocks and will stay hidden inside the ground until a player breaks their respective ore rock. Once a player fully breaks the rock, they will jump out from the ground and attack the player, dealing 25, 30, or 35 damage if it is a coal, iron, or gold rock mimic respectively. If the player is not in the vicinity of the rock mimic, it will burrow itself inside of the location where it is currently standing.

Drops [ ]

A rock mimic rewards 45 Combat XP (180 XP with the 4x daily bonus) and 45 Light Melee , Heavy Melee , Magic , or Archery XP (180 with the 4x daily bonus) depending on the weapon the player used to defeat it.

Using the captain's rapier or consuming a dragon roll or blueberry cookie to increase the player's luck does not increase the amount of basalt , coal , iron ingots , or gold ingots dropped.
