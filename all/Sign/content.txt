Text [ ]

When a player places a sign, their camera will zoom in on the sign at a fixed position. A sign can hold up to 64 characters (4 lines) and also supports emojis and ASCII (somewhat) entirely.

Text written on the sign may be censored by ROBLOX and may be tagged after completing writing.

Despite it not being visible, the user can select text within the sign using Ctrl + A / the Arrow Keys in order to copy and paste or quickly delete text.
