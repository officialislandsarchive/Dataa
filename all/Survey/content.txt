----------------------------------------

A survey was a sort-of quiz which usually asks the survey taker some questions about a place/thing/product. In Islands, there was only one NPC who takes a survey, which was the Mailman. However, on April 1, 2022 , the Mailman has been removed, hence surveys are now inaccessible.

In order to begin, the player must talk to the Mailman to start the survey. The player must select  the "Do the Survey" option.

Once the player completes the survey, they will be rewarded 200 coins and will no longer be able to take the survey.
