Usage [ ]

Auto-smelting [ ]

The industrial smelter can be used to automatically smelt items. It has 6 slots able to hold one item each in its user interface â€” 3 for the raw material and 3 for fuel, both of which can be inputted manually or through the conveyor opening at the back. When powered with coal or petrified petroleum , the industrial smelter will activate for approximately 30 seconds. During this time, it will begin smelting any item inside, taking 10 seconds per item, and will output the smelted item through the conveyor output at the front.

The industrial smelter rewards 4 Forging XP (18 with the 4x daily bonus) for each item smelted.
