Skull Island Resources Palm Tree Villagers Bosco Skull Island was accessible during the Godzilla Vs. Kong event which took place on March 19, 2021 . It was where the Kong quests were located. It was accessed by it's portal in the Hub or by pressing the Kong event button, found on the right of a player's screen.

Resources [ ]

Only two resources could have been found on Skull Island :

Palm Tree Coconuts

Mobs [ ]

The only "mob" found on this island was Kong, who just walked around the island. Kong stopped to drink occasionally, but players were never able to go on him, because he was not a functional object. As he was not a hostile mob, he was immune to any form of weapon damage and had no collision.

Villagers [ ]

Bosco gave quests during the event rewarding the player with the Kong Trophy , Kong's Axe , and the Kong Badge .

Terrain [ ]

Skull River [ ]

A river flows around the middle of the island which Kong walks in, it wasn't deep enough to swim in and didn't hold any Fish .

Bone Piles [ ]

There are 8 bone piles scattered around the island they look exactly like the bones on Desert Island , Bosco's has a quest to study 5 of them. Note: There are bigger bone formations that cannot be studied .

Skull Mountain [ ]

A giant skull can be found atop a mountain to the right of spawn, Bosco asks player's to retrieve his pouch from it.

Mountains [ ]

There are 5 mountains scattered about the island 3 of which have binoculars on them, 1 for the skull and 1 that is useless and extremely hard to climb.

Trivia [ ]

There was originally a glitch that allowed Palm Trees to be chopped down for Oak Wood , but they never respawned. This was fixed minutes after it was found. During the event, exploiters using fly or teleport hacks were rampant. They would teleport and harvest coconuts from trees as soon as they spawned in order to farm saplings. The bone piles are based on the remains of Kong's Family and relatives killed by the Skullcrawlers .
