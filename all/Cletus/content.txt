Trivia [ ]

Cletus is the second NPC that can come to the player's island , the first being the Scavenger who appeared from November 26, 2020 - December 14, 2020. Cletus used to share the same model as Ivon and Jack until the July 23, 2021 update. During the summer, despite saying that watermelons are a "refreshing snack," players cannot eat watermelons. From January 8, 2022 to January 11, 2022, two Cletuses could've came to the player's island as watermelon and pineapples were in two different shops. From January 11, 2022 - January 18, 2022, players could not view Cletus' spring shop. It is presumed that Cletus is siblings with Taliyah in the family painting . Cletus' seed shop was transferred from Tom when the latter got removed from the game during the Halloween 2022 event. This is due to Cletus being the boss for the Halloween 2022 event. He is also the only villager that became one.
