----------------------------------------

This category holds all the items that require a Gamepass to craft and/or use. Crafting station game passes require a one-time purchase. Animal skins only reward one skin per purchase.

Players can buy crafting stations through Vending Machines . However, the recipes cannot be accessed without the respective game pass. Instead, a message will pop up, saying, "You can't use the [insert name of crafting station], unless you have the game pass." Players without the game pass can still place and destroy the gamepass-exclusive items though.
