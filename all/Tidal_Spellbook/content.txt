Trivia [ ]

The tidal spellbook was the first weapon that required a blueprint to craft. It was also the first weapon able to deal AOE damage, and second being the staff of Godzilla . The tidal spellbook's animation used to be a "two hand shove" animation. However, it was changed to the melee swing animation after the March 19, 2021 update. Players were able to defeat the Grand High Witch using the tidal spellbook's AOE damage instead of using the intended method of throwing a potion of formula 86 . This and the Slime Queen's scepter are the only weapons that require another weapon to craft. This weapon used to have the same damage as the spellbook, but was nerfed in a later update. The angle the fireball launches is slightly delayed from the player's actual rotation, making shots inaccurate if the player is moving their camera very quickly. The tidal spellbook deals the same amount of damage as the ruby staffs. Since the June 10, 2022 update, the tidal spellbook no longer deals AOE damage, however as of the October 8, 2022 , it was given back the ability to do AOE damage with an animation of splashing water.
