Trivia [ ]

The trellis is the first block that requires tall grass or birch wood to craft. Despite having farmland at the bottom of it, there are no grass blocks in the recipe. Despite requiring birch wood to craft, the wood color of the trellis is that of maple wood since December 18, 2021 . Placing lava on the top of a trellis will make the lava unable to spill, and breaking the trellis will make the lava float.
