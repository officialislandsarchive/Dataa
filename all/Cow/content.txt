Cow Normal Lunar New Year Old Model Behavior Passive Location Player's Island

A cow is a large passive mob that was added in the October 3, 2020 update and a source of milk .

It is the first animal passive mob in Islands .

Spawning [ ]

The number of cows that can exist on the player's island varies depending on their level in Animal Care .

Player's island [ ]

A cow spawns on the player's island when it first generates.

Cow spawn egg [ ]

Cows can be spawned with cow spawn eggs . Cow spawn eggs are obtained by breeding cows or purchasing them from Taliyah .

Behavior [ ]

A cow can be lured with wheat and can sleep on hay beds . During the Christmas 2021 event, feeding, petting, or milking a cow had a 0.1% chance of rewarding a cow ornament .

Milking [ ]

A cow can be milked using a bucket , creating a milk bucket . Cows can be milked after fully feeding them.

Prior to January 22, 2021 , cows can produce milk buckets without being full even while asleep, due to them being unbalanced.

Breeding [ ]

After two cows have been given a potion of fertility each, they will breed, creating a cow spawn egg . The egg will be of a tier between 1 and 3.

Sleeping [ ]

When it becomes night in-game, cows will go to sleep. While they can sleep anywhere and sometimes will, they prefer to sleep on a hay bed.

Inspecting [ ]

Cows can be inspected to show a menu that allows the player to see information about the cow, listed below:

Mount Sell value Information Food level Favorite foods Happiness level Traits (fertility, productivity, and friendliness) Personality

Feeding [ ]

Cows can be fed approximately every 90 - 100 seconds. Cows eat wheat , but will also each have its own favorite foods. The foods a cow can have as its favorite food are berry pie , honey toast , bread , and tomato soup .

Feeding a cow will increase its food and friendliness level. The food level is necessary to keep above 20% or the cow will start losing happiness. The milking cooldown can also be skipped if a cow is fed.

A wooden trough , metal trough , or automated trough can be used to feed cows.

Like other animals , it will eat from a grass block if no troughs are nearby, but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.

Petting [ ]

A cow can be pet every 5 minutes which increases their happiness level. The action yields 6 Animal Care XP (24 XP with the 4x daily bonus).

Mounting [ ]

Cows can be mounted via the button in the inspect menu if the player is level 8 or higher in Animal Care . A mounted cow can be rode anywhere within the server. If the cow is dismounted outside the player's island, or falls into the void, the cow will respawn on the island spawn point. Mounting a cow does not grant any speed boost or jump boost.

Personality [ ]

Cows are assigned a personality upon spawning. All personalities have the same possibility, except for resourceful which is more uncommon.

Personality Description Effects Trivia Lazy "Your cow is lazy. They sleep for a long time, but gain a bit of happiness while sleeping." Cow will sleep during the afternoon and evening, but will still gain happiness while sleeping. Before the January 22, 2021 update, all cows had the equivalent of this trait. Level-headed "Your cow is level-headed. They will not gain or lose happiness quickly." Self-explanatory Loyal "Your cow is loyal. They are extra happy around players and animals but can become very lonely when left alone." Cow will gain happiness faster if players and/or animals are within an unknown number blocks, but will lose happiness fast if they are further than that threshold. Friendly "Your cow is friendly. They will bring you extra gifts." Cow will bring you extra gifts Resourceful "Woah! Your cow is resourceful. They will produce items faster than other animals." Cow will make products (milk) faster than normal. This is the rarest personality.

Each copy of a skin can only be equipped to one cow.
