This was later removed a few months later. The maximum number of red berry seeds a single player can have in their inventory at one time is 10,000. Joining a new server with more than the limit in the inventory or hotbar will reset it back to 10,000. Utilizing storage blocks such as chests can allow one to bypass the limit.
