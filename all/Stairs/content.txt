Crafting [ ]

The stair crafting ratio is 1:2, meaning that 1 plank , brick , or other material will make 2 of its respective stair type. In the crafting UI, the oak stair, slate stair, and stone brick stair recipes contain the crafting recipes of stairs made with wooden planks, minerals neither smoothed nor cut, and minerals smoothed and/or cut, respectively.

Other stair variants, such as mossy , cobblestone , and void stone , have their recipes separated from the three stair categories above.

Usage [ ]

Stairs are used as a way for players to ascend without jumping.

Stairs can be placed either upright or upside down. Pointing the cursor at the bottom half of a vertical block face will place the stair upright, while pointing it at the top half of a vertical block face will place it upside down.

Despite their appearance, stairs have an inclined plane hitbox.

Dropped items can slide on tilted surfaces, this can make stairs useful for automation as a method of item transportation.

Trivia [ ]

Before the May 21, 2021 update, aquamarine stairs were incorrectly titled as prismarine stairs. Until March 25, 2022 , andesite , diorite , and granite stairs were placed in the wrong stair category in the crafting UI. From March 6, 2022 to March 25, 2022, marble , aquamarine , sandstone , and red sandstone stairs were removed from the crafting UI in the workbench tier 2 , workbench tier 3 , and workbench tier 4 by mistake. However, aquamarine stairs are still uncraftable. Since the March 25, 2022 update, smooth sandstone and smooth red sandstone stairs are able to be crafted in both stair categories instead of solely the brick/smooth stair category. All stairs added after the July 16, 2022 update are not included under the three main stair categories; instead, they are present in their own crafting box.
