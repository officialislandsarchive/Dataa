----------------------------------------

Skill levels , also known as XP levels, is a feature that was added in the January 22, 2021 update. Players can gain XP towards different categories by doing different actions. Upon obtaining a sufficient amount of XP, players may level up and obtain access to new villager trades or crafting recipes. The amount of XP needed to gain a level increases with every level-up.

Every day, there is a daily bonus that quadruples XP gain until a certain amount is reached, this is called your Daily Bonus. The max amount required to finish the daily bonus scales with the level, meaning that higher levels have a higher daily bonus. Upon the end of your Daily Bonus you will not receive its boost. But at the start of each new day it will reset for you to continue using your Daily Bonus. To increase the boost amount, players can also pay 99 Robux for a 50% boost only on one skill, another skill boost would cost another 99 Robux.

Skills are divided into 3 groups differentiated by color: brown, green and red. Brown skills are related to gathering resources/coins, greens are aimed at the production of goods and reds train mostly everything related to combat.

To open the skill levels menu, tap on the three bars icon on the left, or tap the "J" key for PC players.

Trivia [ ]

The maximum level for every skill is 100. Prior to February 3, 2023 , it was 99. The XP and experience orb particles will still be given even if the player has maxed out their skill levels. The "4x daily bonus" will be unavailable and decreased to "0/0". However, the effect of Experience Boost will still affect the amount received of XP. If the player receives 15 XP or less, the amount received of XP will not appear and nothing happens. If the player receives 18 XP or more, the amount received of XP will still appear. However, the amount displayed of XP will be decreased to 20%, 17.5%, 15%, 12.5%, and then 10%. 10% is the minimum amount displayed of XP when receives 501 XP or more. Despite being a "4x daily bonus", the bonus is not always 4x the original amount. The background image of the error message appearing if the player doesn't have the required level to use and item or block used to have a picture from Minecraft Dungeons . This was later changed to the November 1, 2020 update banner. The Economy and Forging are the only two skills that don't have any base stats. Prior to November 13, 2021 , the Cooking skill didn't have a base stat.
