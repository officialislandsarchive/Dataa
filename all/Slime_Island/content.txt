Trivia [ ]

When Slime Island was released, there was a glitch where slimes could get stuck on the portal, making it easier to kill them. This was patched in the May 17, 2020 update, with slimes now going over the portal instead. Before the July 11, 2020 update, it was required to use a slime island key and a weapon in the player's inventory to use the Slime Island Portal in the hub . The key was removed since then, and the portal was free to use without any additional costs or items. The sign next to the Buffalkor Island portal that read "Buffalkor Key" has been removed due to the buffalkor island keys being removed as well.
