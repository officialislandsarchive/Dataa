Dialogue [ ]

When the August 15, 2021 update released, Arius had a glitched dialogue.

"[TODO: Greetings]" >View Shop Leads to shop.

After August 16, 2021, Arius's dialogue was fixed. He may say the lines below:

"Hey, can I interest you in a totem?" >View Shop Leads to shop. "Totems are neat, you can upgrade them too!" >View Shop Leads to shop. "I prefer to use magic to farm! Factories are too noisy." >View Shop Leads to shop.

Trivia [ ]

Obsidian and red sandstone totems were mislabeled as sandstone totems in Arius' shop UI before being corrected shortly afterwards. The model of Arius is very similar to the Zeno kit from BedWars.
