Godzilla Island Villagers Holt Mobs Godzilla

Godzilla Island is an island that could be accessed during the Godzilla Vs. Kong Event through by a portal on the Hub or the Godzilla event button on the right of a player's screen. It is surrounded by a black wall and is the only location that seems to be an island in the water, rather than the sky.

Mobs [ ]

The only Mob found on this island is Godzilla who swims around in the Lake and occasionally stands and roars, shaking the entire game. Players cannot go near Godzilla like they can with Kong.

Villagers [ ]

Holt can be found at the spawn and gives out quests that reward players with the Godzilla Trophy , Staff of Godzilla and the Godzilla Badge .

Terrain [ ]

Lake [ ]

Godzilla swims around the lake, however players cannot swim in the lake due to an invisible barrier blocking it. When Godzilla is near the city, he will rise up, firing his atomic breath in the air.

Turrets [ ]

The Turrets are structures located along the city and emit lasers, which are purely visual effects and doesn't affect the player or mobs in any way. One of Holt's quests requires the player to disable all three of them.

Skyscrapers [ ]

The Skyscrapers are buildings located around the city. One of them has a parkour/obby course, and one of Holt's quests requires the player to complete it.

Rubble [ ]

In the middle of the street a pile of rubble can be found, clearing it is one of Holt's quests.

Trivia [ ]

Unlike Kong's Skull Island , this island has no official name. The buildings on the island are based on the city Hong Kong , as shown in the Godzilla vs. Kong movie.
