Scoring [ ]

Players could have competed in 3-minute butterfly catching contests with other players in the server they are in to earn butterfly tickets . Catching butterflies would give the player their respective colored butterfly jar. The amount of butterfly tickets a player received at the end of the contest depended on the amount of points they scored on the leaderboard. Catching a butterfly with a rarer color variant yielded more points. There was a 40-second cooldown between each contest.
