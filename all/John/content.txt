Trivia [ ]

Players used to be able to sell stone for 2 coins each prior to the January 22, 2021 update. As of the May 8, 2021 update, players can buy water buckets from John for 100 coins, but since players keep the bucket after emptying out the water, players could technically buy buckets from him. Prior to November 18, 2022 , John used to sell sewing buttons .
