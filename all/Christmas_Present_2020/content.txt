A Christmas present 2020 is a roulette block that used to spawn on the player's island during the Christmas 2020 event.

Obtaining [ ]

Spawning [ ]

Christmas present 2020's used to spawn at 9:00 AM (in-game time; approximately every 20 minutes in real time) every day during the Christmas 2020 event. Upon spawning, a short Christmas jingle would play to alert the player of its presence. They spawn on top of any solid block that is not occupied, although they tend to spawn on natural blocks such as grass or stone .

Presents would never replace a block in order to spawn and would always spawn as long as the player's island was still loaded in during the spawn time.

To obtain Christmas presents, players must mine the naturally-spawned block on their island. Once mined, they cannot be manually placed down. Christmas presents will automatically be collected when the block under it is broken, similar to trees .

Trivia [ ]

There was a bug where mobile players couldn't open presents. However, this was fixed later by adding an "open" button above the jump button. Any leftover presents spawned during the Christmas 2020 event would not be removed when the event ended. Since presents spawn on any unoccupied block, players who were active during the event may unknowingly have presents still stuck in hollow spaces on their island . This was the first roulette block .
