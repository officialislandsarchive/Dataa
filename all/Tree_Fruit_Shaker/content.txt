Usage [ ]

Harvesting fruit [ ]

To use the tree fruit shaker, the player must have a fruit tree in-between the machine's "forks", then power the machine using a petroleum pipeline on its side. Once the tree has grown a fruit , the fruit shaker will harvest the fruit and output it through a conveyor belt at the side. When powered with petroleum fuel , the tree fruit shaker will activate for approximately 1 minute.
