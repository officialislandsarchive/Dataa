----------------------------------------

Animal skins (aka animal costumes ) are skins that can be applied to animals. To equip a skin on an animal, a skin must first be purchased from the Robux Shop and then it can be added at the bottom of the inspection UI when inspecting an animal. A skin can only be applied to one animal at a time, but multiple animals can have skins (e.g. 3 cows can all have the "Lunar New Year" skin, 3 sheep can have the "Birthday" skin; the only requirement is that multiple skins have to be bought).
