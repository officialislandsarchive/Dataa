Usage [ ]

Transportation [ ]

Conveyor belts can be used to transport items to and from industrial machines or automatable chests . Left or right conveyor belts are used to make turns. Conveyor belts can be crafted into tier 2 conveyor belts through the workbench tier 4 , which doubles the speed of the conveyor. Conveyor belts can also move players, but not mobs .

Placing a totem next to a conveyor belt will make drop its contents onto the conveyor instead of storing them inside of itself or producing ore rocks . Tomatoes , potatoes , carrots , and onions dropped onto a conveyor belt from a crop totem will become oily .

Trivia [ ]

Although the walls of the tier 2 conveyor belts are taller than normal ones, there is no actual hitbox for the taller walls and is purely visual. Prior to the November 27, 2021 update, left and right conveyors move items and players diagonally rather in the direction of the output, causing round items to get stuck on the corner of the conveyor.
