Obtaining [ ]

Digging [ ]

Players can use a treasure map to help locate buried treasure in the Hub , Slime Island , Maple Isles , Spirit Island , Pirate Island , Buffalkor Island , Wizard Island , or Desert Island , marked with a red 'X' on the map. Players would then have to use a stone shovel or Christmas shovel to dig up the treasure. Using a shovel on the spot will automatically transport the treasure chest to the player's inventory .

Each treasure map only shows the location of one treasure chest, meaning that players are unable to find treasure chests without a treasure map. Once the treasure chest has been dug up, the treasure map will disappear from the player's inventory . Treasure chests dug up in the Hub or Pirate Island are called "Treasure Chests," while ones dug up in the Maple Isles, Spirit Island, Slime Island, Buffalkor Island, Wizard Island, or Desert Island are called "[Island] Treasure Chest."

Treasure chests may spawn in restricted areas such as Fhanhorn's spawn area in the Maple Isles.

Loot [ ]

Treasure chests can be opened by holding "F" on PC, holding it on mobile once it has been placed, or holding X on Xbox while hovering over it. Once opened, the treasure chest will scroll through the items like a roulette wheel and reward one item. Once the item has been collected, the chest will turn into an opened treasure chest .

Trivia [ ]

From October 18, 2021 to October 25, 2021, the green dot representing the player on the treasure map was set at an offset, meaning that it had incorrectly shown the player's location. However, the location of the buried treasure chest marked by the red 'X' was still accurate in accordance to the surrounding terrain. Leaving and rejoining the game while having an unclaimed reward from a treasure chest will display it as an uncommon item, regardless of rarity. Treasure chests that have been opened but the rewards have not been claimed will close when the player goes away. However, the item will still be there spinning, so items like sharks will be seen outside of the chest, still spinning. Prior to April 17, 2023 , breaking treasure chests from islands other than Pirate Island and the Hub would turn it into a regular treasure chest.
