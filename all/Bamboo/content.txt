Climbing [ ]

In similar fashion to ladders , bamboo can be climbed. Both players and animals can climb bamboo.

Farming [ ]

Bamboo can be farmed by planting it on a grass block. Every 2 minutes, bamboo will grow another bamboo on top until it reaches 7-10 blocks in height. Bamboo doesn't grow if there is an occupied block above it. Breaking the bottom most section of bamboo will break all the segments.

When bamboo grows under a water block, it will make the water block disappear.

Bamboo Limit [ ]

A maximum of 40 bamboo can be placed in a single island.  Attempting to place bamboo beyond this limit will produce an error message in chat:

[Error]  Your island has reached the maximum amount of bamboo blocks.

However, bamboo, on its own, can grow beyond this limit.  The limit is on how much a player can place on an island, and not with the total amount of bamboo on the island.

If a stalk is taller than 100 blocks, the bamboo above will not be broken due to the game not being able to fully process deleting all of the bamboo at once.
