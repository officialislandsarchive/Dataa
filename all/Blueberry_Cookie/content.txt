Eating a blueberry cookie restores 15 HP and grants +30% reward luck when defeating mobs for 1 minute.

Upon defeating a mob, the luck effect granted from consuming a blueberry cookie increases the chance of mob drops by 30% of its original value, meaning it multiplies the drop rate of items from mobs by 1.3x. For example, an item with a 0.35% drop chance will now have a 0.455% chance of dropping. Items with a 100% drop rate will be increased to 130%, meaning that it has a guaranteed chance of dropping one and an additional 30% chance of dropping another.

Its luck effect can be stacked with the looting bonus granted from using the captain's rapier and consuming a dragon roll , allowing a maximum increase of 80%, or 1.8x, to be applied to a mob drop.
