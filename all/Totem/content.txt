----------------------------------------

A totem is used to automatically farm crops or minerals . Each totem has a 1x3x1 hitbox and can be purchased from Arius in the Hub using coins .

Totems can store items; once their storage is full, they will stop collecting items until the player empties them. When placed next to a conveyor , totems will automatically drop its items onto it to be transported to industrial machines . A totem is disabled if it within 10 blocks of a totem disabler .

Crop Totems [ ]

Crop totems collect and replant crops in a 3-block radius but do not produce additional seeds . They have 6 slots, each able to hold one crop. Once full, the totem will not harvest or replant crops until the player empties it. At level 1, a crop totem takes 30 seconds to harvest one crop and an additional 30 seconds to drop it onto a conveyor . They grant Farming XP despite the absence of XP particles.

Dispensed tomatoes , potatoes , carrots , and onions become oily , requiring washing in a washing station or an industrial washing station before it can be used or sold.

Cacti , chili peppers , rice , seaweed , raspberries , candy canes , and void parasites don't have a totem.

Mineral Totems [ ]

Mineral totems spawn their respective ore rocks in a 3-block radius. These rocks have the same properties and chances of spawning rare drops (e.g. crystallized iron ) as naturally-spawning ore rocks on other islands ). Mineral totems have 6 slots, each holding 3 items, and a 20-second cooldown between spawning and harvesting. When placed next to a conveyor , they dispense minerals every 30 seconds instead of spawning rocks, but rare drops cannot be obtained this way.

Test Totem [ ]

The test totem was a developer item used for testing purposes and later duped in large quantities. It previously functioned as a faster iron totem with a higher chance to drop crystallized iron , but it now shares equal stats as iron totems. It is only obtainable through trading .

Prior to November 1, 2020 , the test totem model was invisible when held and disappeared if dropped, leaving an invisible hitbox on mobile.

Totem Upgrades [ ]

Most totems, except test totems and berry totems ( red berry , blueberry , and blackberry ) can be upgraded with coins and specific minerals. Players can access the upgrade menu via the "Upgrade" button in totem's storage UI, and its stats can be viewed on the left side of its upgrade menu. The totem's appearance changes every 20 levels and at the final level (level 53).

Breaking an upgraded totem refunds all resources spent on upgrades.

Upgrade Types [ ]

Utility [ ]

Nearby crop grow rate: This stat is exclusive to crop totems. It boosts the grow rate of all crops within an 8-block radius, including those of different types and crops that do not have a corresponding crop totem. The boost can be stacked with other totems with this stat. Block hit damage when near: This upgrade stat is exclusive to mineral totems. It boosts players' block hit damage within a 15-block radius, meaning the player can break any block (or tree ) with less hits. The boost can be stacked with other totems with this stat.

Efficiency [ ]

Action speed: This stat boosts the rate of action made by totem, i.e. spawning/breaking ore rocks and harvesting crops . The speed of dropping items on a conveyor IS affected by this upgrade. Action speed at night: This stat upgrade occurs on every 6th efficiency upgrade level. It is similar to the action speed upgrade but only applies at night.

Quality [ ]

Product yield: This stat increases the production yield of totems. Items picked up manually or deposited into a chest reflect the bonus yield. However, machines such as food processors and industrial ovens will only register the item as a single unit, regardless of the bonus. Product yield for each unique nearby totem type: This stat upgrade occurs on every 6th efficiency upgrade level and is exclusive to crop totems. It increases the production yield based on the number of different crop totem types within an 8-block radius. However, berry totems ( red berry , blueberry , and blackberry ) do not contribute to the yield bonus. For example, if a wheat totem has 5% of this stat and there is 1 potato totem, 1 carrot totem, and 2 tomato totems nearby, the wheat totem will gain +20% product yield (5% from each of the four unique totems, including itself).

Trivia [ ]

Crop totems require at least one planted crop to begin harvesting and replanting. Red berry , blueberry , blackberry , and test totems are the only totems that cannot be upgraded. Totems were remodeled on April 16, 2021 , but, until the May 8, 2021 update, their legacy model would appear instead. The remodeled totems used to have a 3x3 hitbox, but this was reverted to the original 1x1 on May 8, 2021. An animation-related lag issue with totems was fixed in the December 10, 2021 update. Pineapple totems initially failed to collect pineapples upon release, but the bug was fixed shortly after. Since the January 15, 2022 update, red berry, blueberry, and blackberry totems have been discontinued and are no longer purchasable from Arius in the Hub. On April 1, 2022 , icons were added to totems to differentiate between totem types. Red berry , blueberry , and blackberry totems can no longer be traded .
