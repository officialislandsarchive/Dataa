Player's Island Current Version 3 Version 2.5 Version 2 Resources See Resources The player's island is a location granted to each and every player upon joining Islands . Each player has their own island, where they can freely build and interact with blocks and items. A maximum of 80,000 blocks can be placed on a player's island.

Traveling [ ]

Players can access their island by entering the large portal in the Hub or by clicking the "Home" button at any time on the right of the screen. Players may access other players' islands if they have been directly invited to one by the owner of the island or by choosing to visit a published island through the explore menu or a join code . The owner of an island can toggle whether another player may place, break, or interact with blocks through the visitor permissions UI .

Owners of the pro gamepass may choose to publish their island, which broadcasts their island on the explore menu . A maximum of 30 players may be on a player's island at once.

Save slots [ ]

A player has the option to start a new save slot by selecting the My Profiles button on the left side of their screen. Each save slot has its own island, skill level , wallet , and inventory , meaning that data from other save slots cannot be directly transferred to another. Players have the choice to create a co-op save slot , which allows up to seven different players with owner permissions to collaborate on an island.

Resetting [ ]

A player can choose to reset their island once every two days by typing "/reset" in the chat. Resetting a player island erases all existing blocks , items , and mobs on the island, but allows the player to retain their wallet , skill levels , and all blocks and items in their inventory and hotbar .

Villagers [ ]

Different villagers will visit the player's island during specific seasons or events . The owner of the island can ask villagers to leave their island by choosing [Ask to leave Island] when interacting with them.

Trivia [ ]

The block limit for player islands was changed a couple of times; the November 7, 2020 update increased the limit from 50,000 blocks to 70,000 blocks, and the February 5, 2021 update increased it to the current amount of 80,000. Due to the horizontal build limit of 333 blocks from bedrock , players are unable to reach another player's island via building. If the player's island is too big for a server, they will be kicked from the game with a message reading, " Your island is too big for this server. Please join a different one. " This was the original reason why private servers are free for Islands . Player islands that were created before the July 17, 2020 update started with a workbench tier 1 instead of a workbench . The plow that is found next to the patch of wheat from an island creation is held by an item port to prevent it from despawning. Villagers and mobs are able to sit on certain furniture blocks but are unable to get out on their own. Breaking the furniture block is the only way to release them. The third version of the player's island can be seen on the loading screen in blocky form. The animal limit of players is actually 7 large and 7 small instead of the 12 large and 12 small stated in the Animal Care roadmap. When totems and machines are almost at the edge the player's islands(X: 145 blocks Y: 60 blocks[X is direction of the portal face]), they do not produce anything.
