Trivia [ ]

The sickle can be used to harvest anything that has the [F] Harvest GUI, but not the [F] Pickup GUI. Prior to an unnamed update, any sickle caused crops to disappear unless the player rejoins the game. Unlike most tools , sickles can be immediately dropped and does not require the player to hold down "Q."
