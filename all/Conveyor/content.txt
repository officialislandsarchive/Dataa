Usage [ ]

Transportation [ ]

The main use for the basic conveyors is to transport items and blocks from conveyor outputs on machines , chests , or totems to conveyor inputs on other machines or chests, although they are also able to transport unmounted players. Randomizers are used to evenly distribute items/blocks from one conveyor line into two while mergers do the opposite. filter conveyors filter up to four different items from a conveyor belt. Split conveyors output items/blocks to the right when powered , and conveyor sensors create an electrical signal when an item passes through it.

Tomatoes , potatoes , carrots , and onions dropped onto a conveyor belt will become oily .

Totems [ ]

Placing a totem next to a straight, left, or right conveyor belt will make it drop its contents on that conveyor instead of storing them inside of itself or producing ore rocks .
