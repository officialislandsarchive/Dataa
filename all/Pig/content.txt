Pig Pig Muddy Piggy Bank Behavior Passive Location Player's Island

The pig is a small animal and passive mob that can be spawned using a pig spawn egg , which can be bought from Taliyah at level 31 Animal Care .

It is the third animal passive mob in Islands .

Uses [ ]

Pigs can dig up a truffle from a tree when they're not hungry. They may also dig up a white truffle if your animal care level is high enough and your pig is happy. However, if the pig is hungry, it will eat the truffle instead. This can be avoided by placing truffle barrels or industrial truffle barrels on the ground. Pigs leave behind dirt piles by the trees where they can dig up the truffles, removing the hole grants you 1 grass block.

Animal Skin [ ]

A pig's skin can be changed to the Piggy Bank skin once the player buys its animal skin for 399 Robux .

Ornaments [ ]

Petting, feeding, or taking a truffle from a pig had a 0.1% chance of rewarding a pig ornament .

Behavior [ ]

Like all animals, the pig can breed. They can be lured and fed with carrots , but will have avocado toast , jam sandwich , or starfruit cake as their favorite food. If they fall into the void, they will respawn at the player's spawn point.

Feeding a pig will increase its food and friendliness level. The food level is necessary to keep above 20% or the pig will start losing happiness.

A wooden trough , metal trough , or automated trough can be used to feed pigs.

Like other animals , if no troughs are in its vicinity, it will eat from a grass block , but doing so will not replenish its hunger meter nor give Animal Care XP.

Mounting [ ]

Pigs can be mounted by the player (requires Level 8 Animal Care ) through the inspection menu, located next to the "Sell Animal" button.

A pig can be ridden anywhere within your server. To get off, press the dismount button on the right of the screen. You can use Tools / Weapons while mounting.

When you dismount the animal when not in your own Playersâ€™ Island, the pig will teleport to the player's spawn point.

Mounting a pig does not grant any boosts.
