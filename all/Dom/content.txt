Trivia [ ]

The large creature that Dom claims he is raising may suggest an update in the future or an upcoming event. It may also be a nod to Islands' sister games, Bedwars. In Bedwars, there is a kit named Dino Tamer Dom . Dom's creature loves pineapples , as suggested in one of his dialogues. His creature also seems to like watermelons and carrots , as one of his dialogues reads "Could use some more large melon crates... carrots too."
