Volcano [ ]

Volcano Resources Obsidian Mobs Bandit The volcano is located at the center of the island, and abundant obsidian rocks spawn in the surroundings. Lava can be found in the crater of the volcano, but it acts just as a neon orange floor due to the fact that it doesn't deal damage to the player.

Trivia [ ]

Despite lava being added in the September 18, 2021 update and swimming in any lava pool in the Underworld deals damage to the player, the lava in the Volcano is still solid and does not harm the player. This is the second permanent island that doesn't have a boss , with the first being Spirit Island . If player stands on top of a certain patch of lava material surrounding the volcano, the sky will turn to night.
