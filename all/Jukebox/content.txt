Usage [ ]

Music [ ]

Players with the jukebox gamepass can play a selection of 14 songs with jukebox disks dropped by hostile mobs or players on PvP Island . Multiple songs can queued; they are played in the order that they were selected in. Queued songs can be removed at any time. Multiple jukeboxes can play different songs at once. A play/pause button is available. 8-bit music notes are emitted when a song is active.

The range of a jukebox is 49 blocks. The farther the player is from a jukebox, the quieter the song gets. Once they surpass 49 blocks away, the selected song will be inaudible.

Trivia [ ]

Prior to August 3, 2020, players without the jukebox gamepass could still queue music in public servers. On August 9, 2020 , the purple, green, and orange jukebox disks were added. During the Farming Festival indigo jukebox disks could be purchased from Cletus . Placing a jukebox close to a chicken will cause it to dance. On April 9, 2022 , some songs were removed due to ROBLOX privating all audios that aren't owned by the group or game owner.
