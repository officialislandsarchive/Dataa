Usage [ ]

Filtering conveyors [ ]

A filter conveyor has 3 possible directions for an item to go: left, straight, and right. Through its user interface, the player can select an item that the conveyor will filter by adding the item into one of the four slots. The left and right directions have two slots each, meaning that only two different types of items can be filtered for the two directions. Any item that is not selected to be filtered to go left/right will be outputted through the conveyor belt at the back.

Adding an item selection through the filter conveyor's UI doesn't use/hold one of the items.

Trivia [ ]

The filter conveyor used to be sorted in the 'Block' category in workbenches instead of the 'Factory' category. Certain items may get stuck in the gap between the filter conveyor and any adjacent conveyors leading to it.
