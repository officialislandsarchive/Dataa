Usage [ ]

Teleporting [ ]

Up to five orbs can be placed into a teleporter pad at once. Of the inserted orbs, the player can choose to teleport to any of the orb's respective location .

Island orbs allow the player to teleport to Slime Island , their own island , the Hub , Pirate Island , Maple Isles , Spirit Island , Buffalkor Island , the Diamond Mines , Wizard Island , Desert Island , the Underworld , or the Void Isles .

Personal orbs can be used to teleport the player to a certain location of their island. The location can be set by equipping the personal orb and holding down the left click button while in the desired destination before inserting into the teleporter pad. The personal orb's destination can be changed at any time. They can be renamed by clicking the edit button at the right end of the banner in the teleporter pad UI with a max character limit of 30.

Boss orbs can be used to teleport the player to the spawn area of the chosen boss .
