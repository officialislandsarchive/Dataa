Crystallized iron has a 1.5% chance of dropping when breaking iron rocks, both naturally-spawning ones and totem -spawning ones as well. It can only be obtained by breaking an iron rock fully, and can never be obtained by breaking it to its halfway point. Iron and test totems will not output crystallized iron onto conveyor belts .

Trivia [ ]

The drop rate for crystallized iron has been changed multiple times since it was added to the game. On September 18, 2020 it was increased, likely due to the addition of drills , which required crystallized iron in its recipe. The limit for crystallized iron is 5,000. Joining a new server with an amount more than the limit in the inventory or hotbar will reset it back to 5,000. Utilizing chests or vending machines can allow one to bypass the limit.
