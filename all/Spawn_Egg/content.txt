----------------------------------------

Spawn eggs are items used to spawn animals or pets . Both types of spawn eggs can only be used on the player's island and will disappear once used. There are currently 9 animal spawn eggs and 16 pet spawn eggs.

Animal spawn eggs [ ]

Animal spawn eggs exist in 3 tiers; all tier 1 eggs can be purchased from Taliyah except for turkey spawn eggs and vulture spawn eggs , which can be purchased from Emma and Rick respectively. The other two tiers can only be obtained by breeding two of the same animal species. The player can only use an animal spawn egg if they have not already reached their large/small animal limit.

Pet spawn eggs [ ]

Different pet spawn eggs are obtained by defeating bosses or opening certain roulette blocks .
