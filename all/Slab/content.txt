Crafting [ ]

The slab crafting ratio is 1:2, meaning that 1 plank , brick , or other material will make 2 of its respective slab type. In the crafting UI, the oak slabs, stone brick slabs, and slate slabs recipes contain the crafting recipes of slabs made with wooden planks, minerals smoothed and/or cut, and minerals neither smoothed nor cut, respectively.

The mossy , cobblestone , and void stone slab variant recipes are separated from the three slab categories above.

Usage [ ]

Placement [ ]

Slabs can occupy either the top half or the bottom half of a block, or both:

Placing a slab on top of a block or in the lower half of a block's side surface creates a bottom slab. Placing a slab on the underside of a block or on the top half of the side surface creates a top slab. Two slabs cannot be placed in the same block.

Slabs cannot be oriented vertically.

Trivia [ ]

Before the May 21, 2021 update, aquamarine slabs were incorrectly titled as prismarine slabs. Andesite , diorite , granite , and basalt slabs are placed in the wrong slab category in the crafting UI. All slabs added after the July 16, 2022 update are not included under the three main slab categories; instead, they are present in their own crafting box. Animals cannot jump over slabs and may instead get stuck in them.
