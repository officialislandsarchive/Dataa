Usage [ ]

Transforming [ ]

Liquid petroleum can be inputted through the pipe opening at the front. It takes 20 seconds to convert one petroleum fuel into petrified petroleum , and does not require any fuel source to be powered, like the Oil Refinery , Fuel Barrel Filler , and Fuel Barrel Extractor .

Presumably, the machine runs on part of the petroleum that it is fed, and therefore 1 Petrified Petroleum is "less than" 1 Petroleum Fuel.

Input Output 1 Petroleum Fuel âž¡ 1 Petrified Petroleum
