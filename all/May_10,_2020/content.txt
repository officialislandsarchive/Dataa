Patchnote #4 [ ]

Rolling out a small bug fix patch.

🗒️ Improve saving for large islands ☂️ Reduce max factory-dropped items to 40 (still 80 on VIP servers. More info below) ⛰️ You can now build on the bedrock block

We've been experiencing major server lag when multiple islands with large factories are in the same server. When too many dropped items exist in the server, the physics will slow to a crawl. This unfortunately ruins the experience for everyone on the server. We're experimenting several ways to solve this problem; for now, we need to lower the item limit to keep servers in a healthy state. VIP servers still have the 80 item limit -- this change only applies to public servers.
