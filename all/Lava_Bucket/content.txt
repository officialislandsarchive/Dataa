Lava Bucket A lava bucket is a bucket filled with lava .

Obtaining [ ]

Filling [ ]

Using an empty bucket on a lava source block will fill it with lava . If the lava source block was on a player island , the block will be consumed in the process. Flowing lava does not fill a bucket. Buckets can also be filled in lava pools in the Underworld .

Usage [ ]

Placing [ ]

Using the bucket on a block will not create a lava source block anymore. The player will get an empty bucket back. Placing lava onto a trellis will make the lava stationary and not spill. Breaking the trellis will make the lava float.
