Usage [ ]

Planting saplings [ ]

The sapling automatic planter automatically plants a sapling on the block in-between its two "forks" if there is no pre-existing block there. Saplings can be inputted through the conveyor belt at one end and powered with petroleum fuel through the pipe at the other. The sapling automatic planter needs 1 unit of petroleum to begin running for approximately 1 minute.

History [ ]

August 15, 2021 Added sapling automatic planter. August 16, 2021 Sapling automatic planters now can plant any sapling. April 29, 2022 Fixed a bug where sapling automatic planters were able to place saplings on any block .

Trivia [ ]

When it was first introduced, there was a bug where the machine could only place down oak saplings . This was fixed the next day. Spirit saplings will not grow when planted next to the machine due to the hitbox being bigger. Spirit saplings also disappear when placed by the machine if a block is on the left or right side of the "forks".
