Coin bags are physical items used for trading coins between players before the January 22, 2021 update. They have been removed and are only obtainable through trading.

Obtaining [ ]

Banker [ ]

Coin bags were purchasable from the Banker , for 10, 100, and 1000 coins .

Usage [ ]

Selling [ ]

Coin bags could be exchanged with the Banker for the same value as the coin bag; 10, 100, and 1000 coins.

Removal [ ]

Coin bags were removed along with the Banker on January 22, 2021 . Players that had coin bags before the update got 15% of the coins added directly to their balance.

They had become an insecure and ineffective way of trading coins and were mainly used by exploiters to duplicate coins. This obsoleteness was most likely the reasoning behind their removal from the game.

Despite their removal, some coin bags still exist in circulation but do not have a practical use as the original Banker who exchanged the coin bags does not exist anymore. The new banker ( Rob ) sells "bank" items, and is one way to access the player's bank account or shared bank account.
