Trivia [ ]

Like pineapples , although the existence of oily starfruit in the game's code implies that it gets oily on conveyors , starfruit cannot get oily. Starfruit (also called 'carambola'), is a tree ( Averrhoa carambola ) in real life rather than a patch growing on the ground in Islands . Also, the starfruit model in-game is only a slice of a real carambola rather than the entire fruit. Upon its release, starfruit weren't edible. This was changed in the July 17, 2020 update.
