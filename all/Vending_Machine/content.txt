Usage [ ]

Trading [ ]

Vending machines are used to sell items and blocks for coins , or vice versa. Economy level 25 is needed to be able to buy from vending machines and Economy level 35 to sell using vending machines. To craft the block itself and edit it, economy level 45 is required for tier one, for tier two you need Economy level 70. Only players with build permission can access the editing interface.

A 10% and 7% tax is applied to transactions in vending machines and tier 2 vending machines respectively.

A vending machine will say "Out of Money" when the machine doesn't have enough money added to cover the cost of buying an item from a player trying to sell. To fix this, the machine's owner would need to add more money.

A vending machine will say "Items Full" when the machine doesn't have any more capacity to hold additional items (tier 1 - 300; tier 2 - 1000). To fix this, the machine's owner would need to remove some or all of the items already inside the machine.

A vending machine will say "Offline" if the machine is empty or if the island owner does not wish for the items inside to be sold. Turning on "BUY ITEM," or "SELL ITEM," will turn the machine back online.

Editing interface [ ]

Mode Buttons Changes whether or not the item displayed can be bought ("SELL ITEM") or sold ("BUY ITEM"). (Sell is the player selling items, giving items for a price; buy is the player buying an item, and taking away items for a price)

Price Management Used to adjust the price for the item to be bought or sold by simply inputting a number and pressing Enter button to confirm the price. The price can be up to 1 billion (1,000,000,000) coins.

Tax Index Shows how many coins the owner pays/gains from buying/selling items after tax.

Restock Button Once an item has been placed inside the vending machine, the restock option will instantly fill the vending machine with the same item from the player's inventory, until it reaches its limit, or the player has no more of the specified item in their inventory.

Withdraw Button Allows the player to withdraw coins inside the vending machine. A player can select to withdraw a specific amount of coins from its balance, or to withdraw all coins. The Coin Balance allows the player to see how much money the Vending Machine currently holds.

Deposit Buttons Allows the player to deposit coins in the vending machine, in a custom quantity up to a limit of 5 billion coins (5,000,000,000) per machine. Depositing coins is made easier by the use of letter shortcuts including, k, M, B. For example, depositing 100,000 coins can be shortened to "100k", 100,000,000 to "100M" and 1,000,000,000 to "1B".

Coins Balance Shows how many coins are currently stored inside the Vending Machine.

Item Slot Inputs items to be bought or sold by selecting the item from the inventory. Clicking the occupied slot will take all but 1 item from the Vending Machine. The regular Vending Machine slot can hold up to 300 items. The Tier Vending Machine 2 slot can hold up to 1,000 items.

Editing Guide [ ]

In order to set up a vending machine correctly, it is advised to take these steps:

Set the shop to its mode. Set the cost of the desired item(s) to be bought or sold. (Note: If the following step is done before this step, other players will be able to buy/sell the item(s) before the correct price is set up). Place the desired item(s) to be bought or sold.

Bugs [ ]

There is a bug when there is an island that has been up for a long time that makes it so Vending Machines are blank and break the client if attempted to open. To fix this, you should restart your island or break and replace the Vending Machines.
