Bugs & glitches [ ]

The Slime King may despawn if two or more players are fighting with it simultaneously, or if the player is riding an animal. Riding an animal may also make the Slime King unable to attack the player. Due to knockback, it is possible for the Slime King to knock the player to Buffalkor Island . If multiple players stand around the Slime King, they can prevent it from moving and dealing damage. When the Slime King uses the lunge attack, it can possibly land on top of the player and glitch them into the ground. It can also fling and ragdoll players if the lunge hits a player. Sometimes, the respawn timer is missing, and the player has to rejoin for the timer to reappear. If multiple players summon the Slime King at once, more than one Slime King may spawn.
