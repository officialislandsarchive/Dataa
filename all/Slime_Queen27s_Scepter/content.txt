Attacking [ ]

Casting [ ]

At level 1 Magic , shots from the Slime Queen's scepter deal a base damage of 46 HP. The shots are fired horizontally in the direction the player is facing, and its damage can be increased by leveling up the Magic skill. If a shot hits a mob , it will heal the player by 5% every 1 second.

Charging [ ]

Charging a shot will increase the amount of damage dealt by 1.35x at full charge. This additional damage can be increased by leveling up the Magic skill and does not affect the amount of health healed by the projectiles.

Health drain [ ]

After three successful fully charged hits, the Slime Queen's scepter will target the closest mob and drain 20 HP five times at a fast rate, dealing a total of 100 HP of damage. The amount of hits needed to perform this ability is depicted by small pink crystals above the player's health bar. The amount of damage dealt can be increased by the player's Magic level.

Trivia [ ]

As of September 17, 2022 , the Slime Queen's scepter is the only Magic weapon that can be charged. Due to a bug after the health drain, the Slime Queen's scepter triggers the charging meter. The Slime Queen's scepters and the spellbooks are the only two magic weapons that can be crafted without a Magic level requirement. Since the September 24, 2022 update, the health drain of the Slime Queen's scepter  actually deals quake damage instead of ethereal damage. As such, the health drain of the Slime Queen's scepter grants the vulnerability effect to a mob and cannot heal the player. This effect was added in the December 23, 2022 update.
