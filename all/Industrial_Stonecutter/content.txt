Industrial stonecutters can be used to automatically cut certain blocks into their brick, tiled, or carved variant when powered with coal or petrified petroleum . It has two slots able to hold one item each in its user interface—one for an unprocessed block and one for fuel. Unprocessed blocks and fuel can be inputted through the conveyor belt at one side of the industrial stonecutter, powering the machine for 50 seconds per fuel source. It takes 16 seconds to fully cut a block, and once cut, the block variant is outputted through the conveyor belt at the other side.
