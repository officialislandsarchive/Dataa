Usage [ ]

Transforming [ ]

Steel mills convert iron ingots into steel ingots . There are a total of four slots inside the machine, each able to hold only one item - one for iron ingots and the other 3 for fuel. It takes approximately 20 seconds to completely transform an iron ingot into a steel ingot.

The input conveyor must be receiving coal or petrified petroleum as fuel and iron ingots to turn into steel ingots. Iron ore will NOT work. After an iron ingot is turned into a steel ingot, the steel ingot will be outputted through the conveyor belt at the other side of the machine. It also yields 3 Forging XP (18 with the 4x daily bonus) for each ingot transformed.
