Carving fossils [ ]

When carving a fossil pile, a UI will appear above the player's hotbar. The player must click when a blue bar, moving back and forth, aligns with a stationary green bar. The green bar changes its position each time the player successfully clicks when the blue bar aligns with it.

If the player manages to click correctly five times without the blue bar being misaligned with the green bar, they will receive a fossil or other items. However, if the player clicks incorrectly four times, the UI will disappear, and they will have to start over again.
