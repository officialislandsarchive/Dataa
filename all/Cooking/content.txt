Trivia [ ]

The strength potion does not have a Cooking level requirement yet the regen potion does. The resistance potion used to show that it was unlocked at Cooking level 58, but even after reaching it, it remained uncraftable. The potion was later removed in the February 5, 2021 update. Prior to April 16, 2022 , tai nigiri incorrectly showed up twice as a skill unlock. Despite being listed to require level 11 Cooking, baked potatoes can be baked successfully without any skill prerequisite. The Cooking roadmap incorrectly states that dragon fruit ice cream and dragon fruit acai bowls can be sold to a villager after reaching level 41. Dragon fruit ice cream and dragon fruit acai bowls can be crafted without any level requirement. Dragon fruit ice cream and dragon fruit acai bowls actually cannot be sold to Petur . Duck eggs benedict incorrectly show up twice as a skill unlock. Blueberry cookies incorrectly show up as a skill unlock. This skill has the second-highest level unlocks out of all skills. This skill's "Cooking Yield" multiplier affects the washing station, allowing for oily farms to be somewhat useful. A higher Cooking skill improves "Cooking Yield" stats but does not affect the Food Processor or foods without a craftable blueprint after cooking. This is the formula for the skill effect on "Cooking Yield." [ (Level x 1%) - 1% ]
