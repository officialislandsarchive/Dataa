The Snow Globe in the Hub There was a bigger version of the snow globe if you walk to the left of the castle once you enter the Hub (the side with the Slime Island portal) and you should see a hatch that you can go through then go to the crack. There, there will be a magnified version of the Snow Globe. This is the most expensive item sold by Santa . The snow globe emits sparkling particles in a similar fashion to The Witches Trophy and the PvP Alpha Trophy .
