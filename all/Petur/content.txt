Trivia [ ]

Before the March 13, 2021 update, Petur only offered to buy 5 different food items with one hot offer. After the update, most food items could be sold anytime and 5 - 6 hot offers would alternate every 24 hours. Hot offers used to simply be a higher price the food sells for. Now, the prices vary and are around a certain range. From January 8, 2022 to January 15, 2022 , all food prices were raised by x1.5. The industrial merchant teleseller cannot sell things to Petur due to his changing prices. Since the November 13, 2021 update, any newer food items are currently cannot be sold to Petur, except pineapple pizzas . The model of Petur is similar to the model of the Baker kit from Bedwars .
