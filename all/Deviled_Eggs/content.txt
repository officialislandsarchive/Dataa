Although the item name is in plural form, deviled eggs are only shown as half of a single egg. Although herbs aren't in the recipe and don't exist in the game, some herbs are sprinkled on the egg. Before the November 13, 2021 update, selling this would give less coins than selling the ingredients individually.
