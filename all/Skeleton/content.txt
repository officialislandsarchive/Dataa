October 16, 2020 Added skeletons. October 17, 2020 Fixed a bug that caused skeletons to ragdoll when hit with spellbooks or tidal spellbooks . November 1, 2020 Removed skeletons.

Trivia [ ]

Before the October 17, 2020, patch, if a skeleton was hit by the tidal spellbook or the spellbook , it would rag-doll and would not be able to move. Skeletons were able to hide in rocks, where projectiles could not hit them. However, it was still possible to still attack them with melee weapons .
