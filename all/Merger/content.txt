Trivia [ ]

The split conveyor and randomizer have the exact same model but with different designs at the top and different conveyor directions. It is the only craftable block added in the August 15, 2021 update that can be crafted in the workbench tier 3 . The merger shares the same crafting recipe as the randomizer.
